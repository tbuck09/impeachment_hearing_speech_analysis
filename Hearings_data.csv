0,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess so the committee, at any time, there is a quorum present.",00:00,Taylor/Kent
1,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Here’s how the committee will proceed for this hearing. I will make an opening statement, and then ranking member Nunes will have the opportunity to make a statement. And we will go to witness statements and then to questions.",00:07,Taylor/Kent
2,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"For audience members, we welcome you and we respect your interest in being here. In turn, we ask for your respect as we proceed with today’s hearing.",00:19,Taylor/Kent
3,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,Mr. Chairman.,00:27,Taylor/Kent
4,Section_1,Adam Schiff,It is the intention of the committee to proceed without disruptions.,00:28,Taylor/Kent
5,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,Mr. Chairman.,00:30,Taylor/Kent
6,Section_1,Adam Schiff,What purpose?,00:32,Taylor/Kent
7,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,May I make a parliamentary inquiry?,00:32,Taylor/Kent
8,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Gentleman will state the inquiry.,00:34,Taylor/Kent
9,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"Mr. Chairman, this is our first hearing under these new set of rules. House Resolution 660 gives you the discretion to allow yourself and the ranking member periods of extended questions of up to 45 minutes each before other members are allowed to ask questions. If possible, we’d like to know the rules of engagement before we get started. Have you made a decision yet as to how many 45 minute rounds you will allow yourself and the ranking member?",00:36,Taylor/Kent
10,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"I have not. As we informed the minority yesterday, we will see how the first period goes and how much material we are able to get through. At that point, the chair will announce the period, if there is a period of the second round, which may be up to 45 minutes. Or we’ll go straight to a five minute questions by members.",01:07,Taylor/Kent
11,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"For audience members, again, we welcome you and your interest. In turn, we expect and will insist on decorum in the committee. As chairman, I’ll take all necessary and appropriate steps to maintain order and ensure the committee is run in accordance with House rules and House Resolution 660.",01:26,Taylor/Kent
12,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.",01:45,Taylor/Kent
13,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In 2014, Russia invaded the United States ally, Ukraine, to reverse that nation’s embrace of the West and to fulfill Vladimir Putin’s desire to rebuild a Russian empire. In the following years, 14,000 Ukrainians died as they battled superior Russian forces.",01:54,Taylor/Kent
14,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Earlier this year, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine on a platform of ending the conflict and tackling corruption. He was a newcomer to politics and immediately sought to establish a relationship with Ukraine’s most powerful patron, the United States.",02:18,Taylor/Kent
15,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"The questions presented by this impeachment inquiry are whether president Trump sought to exploit that ally’s vulnerability and invite Ukraine’s interference in our elections. Whether President Trump sought conditioned official acts, such as a White House meeting or US military assistance on Ukraine’s willingness to assist with two political investigations that would help his reelection campaign. And if President Trump did either, whether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the office of the presidency.",02:35,Taylor/Kent
16,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"The matter is as simple and as terrible as that. Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency, but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their Commander in Chief.",03:09,Taylor/Kent
17,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"There are a few actions as consequential as the impeachment of a president. While the Founders did not intend that impeachment be employed for mere differences over policy, they also made impeachment a constitutional process that the Congress must utilize as necessary.",03:28,Taylor/Kent
18,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"The facts in the present inquiry are not seriously contested. Beginning in January of this year, the president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, pressed Ukrainian authorities to investigate Burisma, the country’s largest national gas producer, and the Bidens, since Vice President Joe Biden was seen as a strong potential challenger to Trump.",03:46,Taylor/Kent
19,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Giuliani also promoted a debunked conspiracy that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the 2016 US election. The nation’s intelligence agencies have stated unequivocally that it was Russia, not Ukraine, that interfered in our election. But Giuliani believed this conspiracy theory referred to as Crowdstrike, shorthand for the company that discovered the Russian hack, would aid his client’s reelection.",04:08,Taylor/Kent
20,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Giuliani also conducted a smear campaign against the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. On April 29, a senior state department official told her that although she had done nothing wrong, President Trump had lost confidence in her. With the sidelining of Yovanovitch, the stage was set for the establishment of an irregular channel in which Giuliani and later others. Including Gordon Sondland, an influential donor to the President’s inauguration, now serving as ambassador to the European Union could advance the President’s personal and political interests.",04:34,Taylor/Kent
21,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Yovanovitch’s replacement in Kiev, Ambassador Bill Taylor, is a West Point graduate and a Vietnam veteran. As he began to better understand the scheme through the summer of 2019, he pushed back, informing Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent and others about a plan to condition US government actions and funding on the performance of political favors by the Ukrainian government. Favors intended for President Trump that would undermine our security and our elections.",05:08,Taylor/Kent
22,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Several key events in this scheme took place in the month of July. On July 10th, Ambassador Sondland informed a group of US and Ukrainian officials meeting at the White House that according to you, Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian president with Trump would happened if Ukraine undertook an investigation into the energy sector, which was understood to mean Burisma and specifically, the Bidens. National Security Advisor Bolton abruptly ended the meeting and said afterwards that he would not be quote, “Part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this,” end quote.",05:39,Taylor/Kent
23,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"A week later on July 18th, representative of the Office of Management and Budget, the White House agency that oversees federal spending, announced on a video conference that Mulvaney, at the direction of the President, was freezing nearly $400 million in security assistance authorized and appropriated by Congress, in which the entirety of the US national security establishment supported. One week after that, Donald Trump would have the now infamous July 25th phone call with Ukrainian president, Zelensky.",06:20,Taylor/Kent
24,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"During that call, Trump complained that the US relationship with Ukraine had not been reciprocal. Later, Zelensky thanks Trump for his support in the area of defense and says that Ukraine is ready to purchase more Javelins, an anti-tank weapon that was among the most important deterrence of further Russian military action. Trump’s immediate response, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” Trump then requested that Zelensky investigate the discredited 2016 Crowdstrike conspiracy theory and even more ominously, look into the Bidens.",06:53,Taylor/Kent
25,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Neither of these investigations was in the US national interest. And neither was part of the official preparatory material for the call. Both however, were in Donald Trump’s personal interest and in the interests of his 2020 reelection campaign. And the Ukrainian president knew about both in advance because Sondland and others had been pressing Ukraine for weeks about investigations into the 2016 election, Burisma, and the Bidens.",07:31,Taylor/Kent
26,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"After the call, multiple individuals were concerned enough to report it to the National Security Council’s top lawyer. The White House would then take the extraordinary step of moving the call record to a highly classified server, exclusively reserved for the most sensitive intelligence matters.",08:03,Taylor/Kent
27,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In the weeks that followed, Ambassador Taylor learned new facts about a scheme that Sondland, even Sondland would describe as becoming more insidious. Taylor texted Sondland quote, “Are we now saying that security assistance and White House meeting are conditioned on investigations?”",08:24,Taylor/Kent
28,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"As summer turned to fall, “it kept getting more insidious,” Mr. Sondland testified. Mr. Taylor, who took notes of his conversations, said the ambassador told him in a September 1st phone call that everything was dependent on the public announcement of investigations including security assistance. President Trump wanted Mr. Zelensky in a public box.",08:43,Taylor/Kent
29,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"“President Trump is a businessman,” Sondland said later. “When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.”",09:10,Taylor/Kent
30,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In a sworn declaration after Taylor’s testimony, Sondland would admit to telling Ukrainians at a September 1st meeting in Warsaw quote, “That resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we have been discussing for many weeks.”",09:28,Taylor/Kent
31,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"The President’s chief of staff confirmed Trump’s efforts to coerce Ukraine by withholding aid. When Mick Mulvaney was asked publicly about it, his answer was breathtaking. “We do that all the time with foreign policy,” he said, “I have news for everybody. Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy. That is going to happen.” The video of that confession is plain for all to see.",09:48,Taylor/Kent
32,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Some have argued in the President’s defense that the aid was ultimately released. That is true. But only after Congress began an investigation. Only after the President’s lawyers learned of a whistleblower complaint. And only after members of Congress began asking uncomfortable questions about quid pro quos.,10:19,Taylor/Kent
33,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"A scheme to condition official acts or taxpayer funding to obtain a personal political benefit does not become less odious because it is discovered before it is fully consummated. In fact, the security assistance had been delayed so long, it would take another act of Congress to ensure that it could still go out. And that Oval Office meeting that Zelensky desperately sought, it still hasn’t happened.",10:40,Taylor/Kent
34,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Although we have learned a great deal about these events in the last several weeks, there are still missing pieces. The President has instructed the State Department and other agencies to ignore congressional subpoenas for documents. He has instructed witnesses to defy subpoenas and refuse to appear. And he has suggested that those who do expose wrongdoing should be treated like traitors and spies.",11:08,Taylor/Kent
35,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"These actions will force Congress to consider, as it did with President Nixon, whether Trump’s obstruction of the constitutional duties of Congress constituted additional grounds for impeachment. If the President can simply refuse all oversight, particularly in the context of an impeachment proceeding, the balance of power between our two branches of government will be irrevocably altered. That is not what the Founders intended. And the prospects for further corruption and abuse of power, in this administration or any other, will be exponentially increased.",11:34,Taylor/Kent
36,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"This is what we believe the testimony will show, both as to the President’s conduct and as to his obstruction of Congress. The issue that we confront is the one posed by the President’s acting Chief of Staff when he challenged Americans to “get over it.” If we find that the President of the United States abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, or if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts, a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid, must we simply “get over it”?",12:11,Taylor/Kent
37,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Is this what Americans should now expect from their president? If this is not impeachable conduct, what is? Does the oath of office itself, requiring that our laws be faithfully executed, that our president defend a constitution that balances the powers of its branches, setting ambition against ambition so we become no monarchy, still have meaning?",12:57,Taylor/Kent
38,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"These are the questions we must ask and answer. Without rancor if we can, without delay regardless, and without party favor and without prejudice if we are true to our responsibilities. Benjamin Franklin was asked what kind of a country America was to become. “A Republic, he answered, “if you can keep it.” The fundamental issue raised by the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump is, “Can we keep it?”",13:24,Taylor/Kent
39,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"In a July open hearing of this committee following publication of the Mueller report, the Democrats engaged in a last-ditch effort to convince the American people that President Trump is a Russian agent. That hearing was the pitiful finale of a three year long operation by the Democrats, the corrupt media and partisan bureaucrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election. After the spectacular implosion of their Russia hoax on July 24th in which they spent years denouncing any Republican, whoever shook hands with a Russian. On July 25th they turned on a dime and now claim the real malfeasance is Republican’s dealings with Ukraine. In the blink of an eye, we’re asked to simply forget about Democrats on this committee falsely claiming they had more than circumstantial evidence of collusion between President Trump and Russians. We should forget about them reading fabrications of Trump, Russia, collusion from the steel dossier into the congressional record.",00:00,Taylor/Kent
40,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"We should also forget about them trying to obtain nude pictures of Trump from Russian pranksters who pretended to be Ukrainian officials. We should forget about them leaking a false story to CNN while he was still testifying to our committee claiming that Donald Trump jr. was colluding with WikiLeaks. And forget about countless other deceptions, large and small that make them the last people on earth with the credibility to hurl more preposterous accusations at their political opponents.",01:13,Taylor/Kent
41,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"And yet now here we are, we’re supposed to take these people at face value when they trot out a new batch of allegations. But anyone familiar with the Democrats, scorched earth war against President Trump would not be surprised to see all the typical signs that this is a carefully orchestrated media smear campaign. For example, after vowing publicly that impeachment requires bipartisan support, Democrats are pushing impeachment forward without the backing of a single Republican.",01:49,Taylor/Kent
42,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"The witnesses deemed suitable for television by the Democrats were put through a closed-door audition process and a cult-like atmosphere in the basement of the Capitol where Democrats conducted secret depositions, released a flood of misleading and one-sided leaks and later selectively release transcripts in a highly staged manner. Violating their own guidelines Democrats repeatedly redacted from the transcripts the name of Alexandra Chalupa. A contractor for the Democratic National Committee who worked with Ukrainian officials to collect dirt on the Trump campaign, which she provided to the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign. The Democrats rejected most of the Republican’s witness request, resulting in a horrifically one-sided process where the crucial witnesses are denied a platform if their testimony does not support the Democrats absurd accusations. Notably, they are trying to impeach the president for inquiring about Hunter Biden’s activities. Yet they refuse our request to hear from Biden himself.",02:23,Taylor/Kent
43,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"The whistleblower was acknowledged to have a bias against President Trump, and his attorney touted a coup against the president and called for his impeachment just weeks after the election. At a prior hearing, Democrats on this committee, read out a purely fictitious rendition of the president’s phone call with President Zelensky. They clearly found the real conversation to be insufficient for their impeachment narrative, so they just made up a new one.",03:37,Taylor/Kent
44,Section_2,Devin Nunes,And most egregiously the staff of the Democrats on this committee had direct discussions with the whistleblower before his or her complaint was submitted to the inspector general. Republicans can’t get a full account of these contacts because Democrats broke their promise to have the whistleblower testify to this committee. Democrat members hid these contacts from Republicans and then lied about them to the American people on national television.,04:09,Taylor/Kent
45,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"I’ve noted before, the Democrats have a long habit of accusing Republicans of offenses they themselves are committing. Let’s recall for years they accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia when they themselves were colluding with Russia by funding and spreading the Steele dossier, which relied on Russian sources. And now they accused President Trump of malfeasance and Ukraine when they themselves are culpable. The Democrats cooperated in Ukrainian election meddling, and they defend Hunter Biden’s securing of a lavishly paid position with a corrupt Ukrainian company. All while his father served as vice president.",04:38,Taylor/Kent
46,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Despite this hypocrisy, the Democrats are advancing their impeachment sham, but we should not hold any hearings at all until we get answers to three crucial questions the Democrats are determined to avoid asking. First, what is the full extent of the Democrats prior coordination with the whistleblower? And who else did the whistleblower coordinate this effort with? Second, what is the full extent of Ukraine’s election meddling against the Trump campaign? And third, why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden and what did he do for them? And did his position affect any US government actions under the Obama administration? These questions will remain outstanding because Republicans were denied the right to call witnesses that know these answers.",05:22,Taylor/Kent
47,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"What we will witness today is a televised theatrical performance stage by the Democrats. Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, I’d like to welcome you here. I’d like to congratulate you for passing the Democrats star chamber additions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol. It seems you agreed witting or unwittingly to participate in a drama, but the main performance the Russia hoax has ended and you’ve been cast in the low rent Ukrainian sequel.",06:17,Taylor/Kent
48,Section_2,Devin Nunes,I’ll conclude by noting the immense damage the politicized bureaucracy has done to Americans’ faith in government. Though executive branch employees are charged with implementing the policies set by our president who is elected and responsible to the American people. Elements of the civil service have decided that they not the president are really in charge.,06:54,Taylor/Kent
49,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Thus, as we’ll learn in these hearings. After expressing skepticism of foreign aid and concern about foreign corruption on the campaign trail, President Trump outraged the bureaucracy by acting skeptically about foreign aid and expressing concerns about foreign corruption. Officials alarm at the president’s actions was typically based on second hand, third hand, and even fourth hand rumors and innuendo. They believed it was an outrage for the president to fire an ambassador. Even though the president has full authority to retain or remove diplomats for any reason, at any time.",07:19,Taylor/Kent
50,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Officials show the surprising lack of interest in the indications of Ukrainian election meddling that deeply concerned the president at whose pleasure they serve. Despite all their dissatisfaction with President Trump’s Ukraine policy, the president approved the supply of weapons to Ukraine. Unlike the previous administration, which provided blankets as defense against invading Russians. By undermining the president, who they are supposed to be serving, the elements of the FBI, the Department of Justice, and now the State Department have lost the confidence of millions of Americans who believe that their vote should count for something. It will take years, if not decades, to restore faith in these institutions.",08:01,Taylor/Kent
51,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"This spectacle is doing great damage to our country. It’s nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime. With that, I yield back.",08:54,Taylor/Kent
52,Section_2,Bill Taylor,"I’m appearing today at the Committee’s request to provide my perspective on the events that are the subject of the Committee’s inquiry. I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the Committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings. My sole purpose is to provide facts as I know them about the incidents in question as well as my views about the strategic importance of Ukraine to the United States.",00:00,Taylor/Kent
53,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"By way of background, it has been a privilege for me to serve our country and the American people for more than 50 years. Starting as a cadet at West Point is, you have mentioned Mr. Chairman, then as an infantry officer for six years, including with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, then at the Department of Energy, then as a member of a senate staff, then at NATO, then with the State Department here and abroad in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem, and Ukraine. I retired from the State Department in 2009 to join the United States Institute of Peace. I’m neither a career member of the Foreign Service nor of the civil service. I am nonpartisan and have been appointed to my positions by every president from President Reagan to President Trump.",00:36,Taylor/Kent
54,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Let me summarize my main points. First, Ukraine is a strategic partner of the United States, important for the security of our country as well as Europe. Ukraine is on the frontline in the conflict with the newly aggressive Russia. Second, even as we sit here today, the Russians are attacking Ukrainian soldiers in their own country and have been for the last four years. I saw this on the frontline last week. The day I was there, a Ukrainian soldier was killed, and four were wounded. Third, the security assistance we provide is crucial to Ukraine’s defense and to the protection of the soldiers I met on the frontline last week. It demonstrates to Ukrainians and Russians that we are Ukraine’s reliable strategic partner. It is clearly in our national interest to deter further Russian aggression.",01:20,Taylor/Kent
55,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Finally, as the Committee is aware, I wrote that withholding security assistance in exchange for help with a domestic political campaign in the United States would be crazy. I believe that then, and I believe it now. Let me tell you why. On May 28th of this year, I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who asked me to rejoin the State Department and return to Kyiv to lead our embassy in Ukraine. It was and is a critical time for US-Ukraine relations. I had served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009 having been nominated by George W. Bush, and in the intervening 10 years, had stayed engaged with Ukraine.",02:23,Taylor/Kent
56,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Across the responsibilities I have had in public service, Ukraine is the highlight, and so Secretary Pompeo’s offer to return as chief of mission was compelling. Since I left Ukraine in 2009, the country had continued to turn towards the west, but in 2013, Vladimir Putin was so threatened by the prospect of Ukraine joining the European Union that he tried to bribe the Ukrainian president. This triggered mass protest in the winter of 2013 that drove that president to flee to Russia in February of 2014, but not before his forces killed a hundred Ukrainian protesters in the Central Kyiv.",03:06,Taylor/Kent
57,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Days later, Mr. Putin invaded Crimea, holding a sham referendum at the point of Russian army rifles. The Russians absurdly claim that 97% voted to join Russia. In early April, Putin sent his army and security forces into South Eastern Ukraine to generate illegal armed formations and puppet governments and what we know is Donbass. You can see this on the map in right-hand portion, in the eastern portion of the country. 14,000 Ukrainians have died in the war in Donbass, and more die each week.",03:50,Taylor/Kent
58,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"In July of 2014 these Russian-led forces in Donbass shut down a civilian airliner en route from Amsterdam to Malaysia, killing all 298 people on board. We, the Europeans, and most of the west imposed economic sanctions and kicked the Russians out of the G8. Beginning in 2014, we and NATO began to provide military assistance to Ukraine’s armed forces in the form of training, advice, military equipment, and weapons. It is this security assistance that is at the heart of the controversy that we are discussing today. The pro-Russian president who was run out of Kyiv in 2014 had let the Russian armed forces deteriorate to the point of ruin. In response to the Russian invasion, the new Ukrainian authorities, with an amazing outpouring of support from regular Ukrainian people, rebuilt the army nearly from scratch, spending more than 5% of Ukrainian GDP on defense since the war started. The whole Ukrainian nation fiercely responded to the Russian attack. The nation united like never before. A ragtag army developed into a strong fighting force, and the United States played a vital role.",04:27,Taylor/Kent
59,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Since 2014, you and Congress have provided over $1.6 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. The security assistance provides small unit training at an army base near Lviv in the western of the country. It provides ambulances, night vision devices, communications equipment, counter battery radar, navy ships, and finally, weapons. The security systems demonstrates our commitment to resist aggression and defend freedom.",05:47,Taylor/Kent
60,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"During the 2014 to 2016 period, I was serving outside of government and joined two other former ambassadors to Ukraine and urging the Obama administration officials at the State Department, Defense Department, and other agencies to provide lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine in order to deter further Russian aggression. I also supported much stronger sanctions on Russia. I was pleased when the Trump administration provided Javelin anti-tank missiles and enacted stronger sanctions. All to say, I cared about Ukraine’s future and the important US interests there, so when Secretary Pompeo asked me to go back to Kyiv, I wanted to say yes, but it was not an easy decision. The former Ambassador Masha Yovanovitch has been treated poorly, caught in a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and in Washington. I feared that those problems were still present.",06:16,Taylor/Kent
61,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"I consulted both my wife and a respected former senior Republican official who has been a mentor. I will tell you that my wife in no uncertain terms strongly opposed to the idea. The mentor counseled, “If your country ask you to do something, you do it if you can be effective.” I could be effective only if the US policy of strong support for Ukraine, strong diplomatic support along with robust security, economic, and technical assistance were to continue, and if I had the backing of the secretary of state to implement that policy, and I worried about what I had heard concerning the role of Rudy Giuliani, who had made several controversial statements about Ukraine and US policy toward the country. During my meeting with Secretary Pompeo on May 28, I made clear to him and the others present that if US policy toward Ukraine changed, he would not want me posted there, and I could not stay. He assured me that the policy of strong support for Ukraine would continue and that he would support me in defending that policy. With that understanding, I agreed to go back to Kyiv. Because I was appointed by the Secretary but not reconfirmed by the Senate, my official position was chargé d’affaires ad interim. In effect, I was the acting ambassador to Ukraine.",07:13,Taylor/Kent
62,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"I returned to Kyiv on June 17th, carrying the original copy of a letter President Trump signed the day after I met with the Secretary. In that letter, President Trump congratulated President Zelensky on his election victory and invited him to a meeting in the Oval Office. But once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances.",08:40,Taylor/Kent
63,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"First, the encouraging: President Zelensky was reforming Ukraine in a hurry. He appointed reformist ministers and supported long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He took quick executive action, including opening Ukraine’s High Anti-Corruption Court. With a new parliamentary majority stemming from snap elections, President Zelensky changed the Ukrainian Constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada deputies, the source of raw corruption for two decades. The excitement in Kyiv was palpable. This time could be different, a new Ukraine finally breaking from its corrupt, post-Soviet past.",09:07,Taylor/Kent
64,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Yet, I found a confusing and unusual arrangement for making US policy toward Ukraine. There appeared to be two channels of US policy-making and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the acting ambassador, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes, including the bulk of the US effort to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion and to help it defeat corruption. My colleague, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent and our colleagues at the National Security Council were my main points of contact in Washington in this regular channel. This channel is formally responsible for formulating and overseeing the implementation of US foreign policy with respect to Ukraine, a policy that has consistently enjoyed strong, bipartisan support, both in Congress and in all administrations since Ukraine’s independence from Russia in 1991.",09:47,Taylor/Kent
65,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"At the same time, however, I encountered an irregular, informal channel of US policy-making with respect to Ukraine, unaccountable to Congress, a channel that included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker, US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and, as I subsequently learned, Mr. Giuliani. I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland including me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Department channels. The irregular channel began when Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Senator Ron Johnson briefed President Trump on May 23 upon their return from President Zelensky’s inauguration. The delegation was as enthusiastic as I would soon become about the new Ukrainian president and urged President Trump to meet with him early on to cement the US-Ukraine relationship. But from what I understood from the participants, President Trump did not share their enthusiasm for a meeting with President Zelensky.",10:42,Taylor/Kent
66,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"When I arrived in Kyiv, the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy appeared to serve the same goal: a strong US-Ukraine partnership. But it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives. As this occurred, I became increasingly concerned. In late June, both channels were trying to facilitate a visit by President Zelensky to the White House for a meeting with President Trump, which President Trump had promised in his congratulatory letter of May 29. The Ukrainians were clearly eager for the meeting to happen.",12:08,Taylor/Kent
67,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"But during my subsequent communications with Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, they relayed to me that the President wanted to hear from Zelensky before scheduling the meeting in the Oval Office. It was not clear to me what this meant. On June 27, Ambassador Sondland told me during a phone conversation that President Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that he, President Zelensky, was not standing in the way of investigations.",12:48,Taylor/Kent
68,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"I sensed something odd when Ambassador Sondland told me on June 28 that he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants in a call planned with President Zelensky later that day. Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker, Secretary Perry, and I were on this call, dialing in from different locations; however, Ambassador Sondland said that he wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring as they added President Zelensky to the call. Also, before President Zelensky joined the call, Ambassador Volker separately told the US participants that he, Ambassador Volker, planned to be explicit with President Zelensky in a one-on-one meeting in Toronto on July 2. In that meeting, Ambassador Volker planned to make clear-",13:17,Taylor/Kent
69,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"In that meeting, Ambassador Volker planned to make clear what President Zelensky should do, to get the White House meeting. I did not understand what this meant, but Ambassador Volker said he would relay that President Trump wanted to see rule of law, transparency, but also specifically, cooperation on investigations, to get to the bottom of things. Once President Zelensky joined the call, the conversation was focused on energy policy, and the war in Donbass. President Zelensky also said he looked forward to the White House visit President Trump had offered in his May 29th letter.",14:03,Taylor/Kent
70,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"By mid-July, it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma, and alleged Ukrainian interference and the 2016 U.S. elections. It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani. In a regular NSC secure video conference call on July 18th, I heard a staff person from the Office of Management and Budgets say that there was a hold on security assistance to Ukraine, but could not say why. Toward the end of an otherwise normal meeting, a voice on the call… The person was off screen… said that she was from OMB, and her boss had instructed her not to approve any additional spending on security assistance for Ukraine until further notice. I, and others, sat in astonishment. Ukrainians were fighting Russians, and counted on not only the training and weapons, but also the assurance of U.S. support. All that the OMB staff person said was that the directive had come from the president, to the chief of staff, to OMB. In an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened. The regular policy channel was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy.",14:38,Taylor/Kent
71,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"There followed a series of NSC-led inter-agency meetings, starting at the staff level, and quickly reaching the level of cabinet secretaries. At every meeting, the unanimous conclusion was that the security assistance should be resumed, the hold lifted. At one point, the Defense Department was asked to perform an analysis of the effectiveness of the assistance. Within a day, the Defense Department came back with a determination that the assistance was effective, and should be resumed. My understanding was that the secretaries of defense and state, the CIA director, and the national security advisor sought a joint meeting with the president to convince him to release the hold, but such a meeting was hard to schedule, and the hold lasted well into September.",16:03,Taylor/Kent
72,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"On July 9th, in a phone call with then-Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs Fiona Hill, and Director of European Affairs, Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vindman at the NSC, they tried to assure me that they were not aware of any official change in U.S. policy towards Ukraine, OMB’s announcement notwithstanding. They did confirm that the hold on security assistance for Ukraine came from Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who maintained a skeptical view of Ukraine.",16:46,Taylor/Kent
73,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"In the same July 19th phone call, they gave me an account of a July 10th meeting with Ukrainian and American officials at the White House. They told me that partway through the meeting, Ambassador Sondland had connected investigations with an Oval Office meeting for President Zelensky, which so irritated then-national security advisor John Bolton, that he abruptly ended the meeting, telling Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman that they should have nothing to do with domestic politics. He also directed Dr. Hill to, “Brief the lawyers.” Dr. Hill said that Ambassador Bolton referred to this deal as, “This is a drug deal,” after the July 10th meeting. Ambassador Bolton opposed a call between President Zelensky and President Trump, out of concern that it would be a disaster.",17:17,Taylor/Kent
74,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Needless to say, the Ukrainians in the meetings were confused. Ambassador Bolton and the regular Ukraine policy decision making channel wanted to talk about security, energy, and reform. Ambassador Sondland, a participate in the irregular channel, wanted to talk about the connection between a White House meeting and Ukrainian investigations.",18:08,Taylor/Kent
75,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Also during our July 190th call, Dr. Hill informed me that Ambassador Volker had met with Mr. Giuliani to discuss Ukraine. This caught me by surprise. The next day I asked Ambassador Volker about that meeting, but received no response. I began to sense that these two separate decision making channels, the regular and the irregular, were separate and at odds.",18:28,Taylor/Kent
76,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Later that day, I received text messages on a three-way WhatsApp text conversation with Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, a record of which was provided by Ambassador Volker. Ambassador Sondland said that a call between President Trump and President Zelensky would take place soon. Ambassador Volker said that what was most important is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation, and address any specific personnel issues, if there are any.",18:52,Taylor/Kent
77,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"On the next day, July 20th, I had a phone conversation with Ambassador Sondland, while he was on a train from Paris to London. Ambassador Sondland told me that he had recommended to President Zelensky that he use the phrase, “I will leave no stone unturned with regard to investigations,” when President Zelensky spoke with President Trump.",19:20,Taylor/Kent
78,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Also on July 20th, I had a phone conversation with Alexander [inaudible 00:19:54], President Zelensky’s National Security Advisor, who emphasized that President Zelensky did not want to be used as an instrument in a U.S. reelection campaign. The next day, I texted both Ambassadors Volker and Sondland about President Zelensky’s concern.",19:49,Taylor/Kent
79,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"On July 25th, President Trump and President Zelensky had the long-awaited phone conversation. Even though I was acting ambassador, and was scheduled to meet with President Zelensky along with Ambassador Volker the following day, I received no readout of the call from the White House. The Ukrainian government issued a short, cryptic summary.",20:15,Taylor/Kent
80,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"During a previously planned July 26th meeting, President Zelensky told Ambassador Volker and me that he was happy with the call, but did not elaborate. President Zelensky then asked about the face to face meeting in the Oval Office, as promised in the May 29th letter from President Trump. We could give him no firm answer.",20:35,Taylor/Kent
81,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"After our meeting with President Zelensky, Ambassador Volker and I traveled to the front line in northern Donbass to receive a briefing from the commander of forces on the line of contact. Arriving for the briefing in the military headquarters, the commander thanked us for the security assistance, but I was aware that this assistance was on hold, which made me uncomfortable. Ambassador Volker and I could see the armed and hostile Russian-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge, across the line of contact. Russian-led forces continued to kill Ukrainians in the war, one or two a week. More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance.",20:56,Taylor/Kent
82,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Although I spent the morning of July 26th with President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials, the first summary of the July 25th Trump/Zelensky call that I heard from anybody inside the U.S. government was during a phone call I had with Tim Morrison, Dr. Hill’s recent replacement at the NSC, on July 28th. Mr. Morrison told me that the call could have been better, and that President Trump had suggested that President Zelensky or his staff meet with Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. I did not see any official readout of the call until it was publicly released on September 25th.",21:36,Taylor/Kent
83,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"By August, I was becoming more concerned. On August 16th I exchanged text messages with Ambassador Volker, in which I learned that Andriy Yermak, a senior advisor to President Zelensky, had asked that the United States submit an official request for an investigation into Burisma’s alleged violations of Ukrainian law, if that is what the United States desired. A formal U.S. request to the Ukrainians to conduct an investigation based on violations of their own law struck me as improper, and I recommended to Ambassador Volker that we stay clear. To find out the legal aspects of the question, however, I gave him the name of a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, whom I thought would be the proper point of contact for seeking a U.S. request for a foreign investigation.",22:16,Taylor/Kent
84,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"By mid-August, because the security assistance had been held for over a month, for no reason that I could discern, I was beginning to fear that the longstanding U.S. policy of support for Ukraine was shifting. I called State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl to discuss this on August 21st. He said he was not aware of a change in policy, but would check on the status of the security assistance.",23:06,Taylor/Kent
85,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"My concern deepened the next day, on August 22nd, during a phone conversation with Mr. Morrison. I asked him if there had been a change in policy of strong support for Ukraine, to which he responded, “It remains to be seen.” He also told me during this call that, “The president doesn’t want to provide any assistance at all.” That was extremely troubling to me, as I had told Secretary Pompeo in May if the policy of strong support for Ukraine were to change, I would have to resign. Based on my call with Mr. Morrison, I was preparing to do so.",23:31,Taylor/Kent
86,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Just days later, on August 27th, Ambassador Bolton arrived in Kiev, and met with President Zelensky. During their meeting, security assistance was not discussed. As far as I knew, the Ukrainians were not aware of the hold until August 29th. I, on the other hand, was all too aware of, and still troubled by the hold. Near the end of Ambassador Bolton’s visit, I asked to meet him privately, during which I expressed to him my serious concern about the withholding of military assistance to Ukraine while the Ukrainians were defending their country from Russian aggression. Ambassador Bolton recommended that I send a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo directly, relaying my concerns.",24:07,Taylor/Kent
87,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"I wrote and transmitted such a cable on August 29th, describing the folly I saw in withholding military aid to Ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the east, and when Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American support for the Ukrainian government. “The Russians,” as I said in my deposition, “would love to see the humiliation of President Zelensky at the hands of the Americans.” I told the secretary that I could not and would not defend such a policy. Although I received no specific response, I heard that soon thereafter, the secretary carried the cable with him to a meeting at the White House focused on security assistance to Ukraine.",24:51,Taylor/Kent
88,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"The same day that I sent my cable to the secretary, Mr. Yermak contacted me very concerned, asking about the withheld security assistance. The hold that the White House had placed on assistance had just been made public that day, in a political story. At that point, I was embarrassed that I could give him no explanation for why it was withheld. It had still not occurred to me that the hold on security assistance could be related to the investigations. That, however, would change.",25:32,Taylor/Kent
89,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"On September 1st, just three days after my cable to Secretary Pompeo, President Zelensky met Vice President Pence at a bilateral meeting in Warsaw. President Trump had planned to travel to Warsaw, but at the last minute had canceled because of Hurricane Dorian. Just hours before the Pence/Zelensky meeting, I contacted Mr. [inaudible 00:26:22], to let him know that the delay of U.S. assistance was an all or nothing proposition, in the sense that if the White House did not lift the hold prior to the end of the fiscal year, September 30th, the funds would expire, and Ukraine would receive nothing. I was hopeful that at the bilateral meeting, or shortly thereafter, the White House would lift the hold, but this was not to be.",26:01,Taylor/Kent
90,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"On the evening of September 1st, I received a readout of the Pence/Zelensky meeting over the phone from Mr. Morrison, during which he told me that President Zelensky had opened the meeting by immediately asking the vice president about the security cooperation. The vice president did not respond substantively, but said that he would talk to President Trump that night. The vice president did say that President Trump wanted the Europeans to do more to support Ukraine, and that he wanted the Ukrainians to do more to fight corruption.",26:46,Taylor/Kent
91,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"During the same phone call with Mr. Morrison, he described a conversation Ambassador Sondland had with Mr. Yermak in Warsaw. Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation. I was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the Sondland/Yermak conversation. I understand that Mr. Morrison testified in his deposition that Ambassador Sondland proposed it might be sufficient for the Ukrainian prosecutor general to commit to pursue the investigations, as opposed to President Zelensky. But this was the first time that I had heard that the security assistance, not just the White House meeting, was conditioned on the investigation.",27:17,Taylor/Kent
92,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"… house meeting was conditioned on the investigations. Very concerned, on that same day, September 1st, I sent Ambassador Sondland a text message asking if we are now saying that the security assistance and a White House meeting are conditioned on investigations. Ambassador Sondland responded asking me to call him, which I did. During that phone call Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Ambassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling Ukrainian officials that only a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of the investigations. In fact, Ambassador Sondland said, everything was dependent on such an announcement including security assistance. He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky in a public box by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.",28:02,Taylor/Kent
93,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"In the same September 1st call, I told Ambassador Sondland that President Trump should have more respect for another head of state and that what he described was not in the interest of either President Trump or President Zelensky. At that point, I asked Ambassador Sondland to push back on President Trump’s demand. Ambassador Sondland pledged to try. I suggested the possibility that Ukrainian prosecutor general rather than President Zelensky would make a statement about the investigations, potentially in coordination with the Attorney General Barr’s probe into the investigation of interference in the 2016 elections.",29:09,Taylor/Kent
94,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"The next day, September 2nd Mr. Morrison called to informed me that Mr. [Donneluc 00:29:54] had asked him to come to his hotel in Warsaw. So Donneluc expressed President Zelensky’s concern about the possible loss of US support for Ukraine. In particular, Mr. Morrison relayed to me that the inability of any US officials to respond to the Ukrainians explicit questions about security assistance was troubling them.",29:48,Taylor/Kent
95,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"I was experiencing the same tension in my dealings with the Ukrainians, including a meeting I’d had with a defense minister that day. On September 5th, I accompanied Senators Johnson and Murphy during their visit to Kiev. When we met with President Zelensky, his first question to the senators was about the withheld security assistance. My recollection of the meeting is that both Senators stressed that bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington was Ukraine’s most important strategic asset and that President Zelensky should not jeopardize that bipartisan support by getting drawn in to US domestic politics.",30:16,Taylor/Kent
96,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"I had been making and continue to make this point to all of my official Ukrainian contacts, but the odd push to make President Zelensky publicly commit to investigations of Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed how the official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani.",30:59,Taylor/Kent
97,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Two days later, September 7th, I had a conversation with Mr. Morrison in which he described a phone conversation earlier that day between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump. Mr. Morrison said that he had a sinking feeling after learning about this conversation from Ambassador Sondland. According to Mr. Morrison, President Trump told Ambassador Sondland, he was not asking for a quid pro quo, but President Trump did insist that President Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference and that President Zelensky should want to do this himself. Mr Morrison said that he told Ambassador Bolton and the NSC lawyers of this phone call between President Trump and Ambassador Sondland.",31:25,Taylor/Kent
98,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"The following day on September 8th, Ambassador Sondland and I spoke on the phone. He confirmed that he had talked to President Trump as I had suggested a week earlier, but that President Trump was adamant that President Zelensky himself had to clear things up and do it in public. President Trump said it was not a quid pro quo. I believe this was the same conversation between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump that Mr. Morrison had described to me on September 7th. Ambassador Sondland also said that he had talked to President Zelensky and Mr. [Yermak 00:04:47] and had told them that although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. I understood a stalemate to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much needed military assistance. Ambassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded with President Zelensky agreeing to make a public statement in an interview on CNN. Shortly after that call with Ambassador Sondland, I expressed my strong reservations in a text message to Ambassador Sondland stating that my nightmare is that they, the Ukrainians, give the interview and don’t get the security assistance. The Russians loved it and I quit and I was serious.",32:10,Taylor/Kent
99,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"The next day, September 9th, I said to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, that the message to the Ukrainians and the Russians we send with the decision on security assistance is key. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. I also said, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with the political campaign",33:34,Taylor/Kent
100,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Ambassador Sondland responded about five hours later that I was incorrect about President Trump’s intentions. The President has been crystal clear. No quid pro quos of any kind. During our meeting, during our call on September 8th, Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check. Ambassador Volker used the same language several days later while we were together at the Yalta European Strategy Conference. I argued to both that the explanation made no sense. Ukrainians did not owe President Trump anything and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was crazy. As I had said in my text message to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker on September 9th. Finally on September 11th, I learned that the hold had been lifted and security assistance would be provided. I was not told the reason why the hold had been lifted.",33:58,Taylor/Kent
101,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"The next day, I personally conveyed the news to President Zelensky and the Ukrainian foreign minister and I again reminded Mr Yermak of the highest strategic value of bipartisan support for Ukraine and the importance of not getting involved in other countries’ elections. My fear at the time was since Ambassador Sondland had told me President Zelensky had already agreed to do a CNN interview, President Zelensky would make a statement regarding investigations that would have played into domestic US politics. I sought to confirm through Mr. Donneluc that President Zelensky was not planning to give such an interview to the media. While Mr. Donneluc initially confirmed that on September 12th, I noticed during a meeting on the morning of September 13th at President Zelensky’s office that Mr. Yermak looked uncomfortable in response to the question. Again, I asked Mr. Donneluc to confirm that there would be no CNN interview, which he did.",34:59,Taylor/Kent
102,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"On September 25th at the UN General Assembly session in New York City, President Trump met President Zelensky face to face. He also released the transcript of the July 25th call. United States gave the Ukrainians virtually no notice of the release and they were livid. Although this was the first time I had seen the details of President Trump’s July 25th call with President Zelensky, in which he mentioned Vice President Biden, I had come to understand well before then that investigations was a term Ambassadors Volker and Sondland used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections and to investigations of Burisma and the Bidens.",35:54,Taylor/Kent
103,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Last Friday, a member of my staff told me of events that occurred on July 26th. While Ambassador Volker and I visited the front as a member of my staff accompanied Ambassador Sondland. Ambassador Sondland met with Mr Yermak. Following that meeting in the presence of my staff at a restaurant Ambassador Sondland called President Trump and told him of his meetings in Kiev. The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking Ambassador Sondland about the investigations. Ambassador Sondland told President Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward. Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden which Giuliani was pressing for.",36:42,Taylor/Kent
104,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"At the time, I gave my deposition on October 22nd, I was not aware of this information. I’m including it here for completeness. As the committee knows, I reported this information through council to the state department’s legal advisor as well as to counsel for both the majority and the minority of this committee. It is my understanding that the committee is following up on this matter. Mr. Chairman, I recognize that this is rather lengthy recitation of the events of the past few months told from my vantage point in Kiev but I also recognize the importance of the matters your committee is investigating and I hope that this chronology will provide some framework for your questions. As I mentioned in my October 22nd deposition, the information in quotes in my testimony are based on my best recollection as well as a review of my personal notes.",37:34,Taylor/Kent
105,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Let me return to the points I made at the outset. Ukraine is important to the security of the United States, the largest country in Europe by landmass, Ukraine is a young democracy struggling to join Europe and ally itself with the United States. It has been violently attacked by Russia, which continues its armed aggression against Ukraine to this day. If we believe in the principle of the sovereignty of nations on which our security and the security of our friends and allies depends. If we believe that nations get to decide on their own economic, political and security alliances, we must support Ukraine in its fight against its bullying neighbor. Russian aggression cannot stand.",38:29,Taylor/Kent
106,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Republican and Democratic administrations over three decades have been generous with assistance funding both civilian and military and political support. With overwhelming bipartisan majorities, Congress has imposed harsh sanctions on Russia for invading and occupying Ukraine.",39:17,Taylor/Kent
107,Section_3,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Chairman, there are two Ukraine stories today. The first is the one we’re discussing this morning that you have been hearing about for the past two weeks. It’s a rancorous story about whistleblowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption, and interference in elections. In this story. Ukraine is merely an object. But there’s another story, a positive bi-partisan one. In this second story, Ukraine is the subject. This one is about young people in a young nation struggling to break free of its past, hopeful that their new government will finally usher in a new Ukraine, proud of its independence from Russia, eager to join Western institutions and enjoy a more secure and prosperous life. This story describes a nation developing an inclusive democratic nationalism, not unlike what we, in America, in our best moments, feel about our diverse country. Less concerned about what language we speak, what religion, if any, we practice, where our parents and grandparents came from, more concerned about building a new country. And I’m now looking forward to your questions.",39:37,Taylor/Kent
108,Section_3,George Kent,"Good morning. My name is George Kent, and I am the deputy assistant secretary of state for Eastern Europe and the Caucuses. I have served proudly as a nonpartisan career foreign service officer for more than 27 years under five presidents, three Republican and two Democrat. As I mentioned in my opening comments last month in the closed-door deposition, I represent the third generation of my family to have chosen a career in public service and sworn the oath of office that all US public servants do in defense of our Constitution. Indeed, there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the constitution continuously for nearly 60 years, ever since my father reported to Annapolis for his plebe summer. After graduating first in his Naval Academy class in 1965, the year best known for his Heisman-winning classmate, Roger Staubach, my father served a full, honorable 30 years, including as a captain of a nuclear ballistic missile submarine during the height of the Cold War.",00:00,Taylor/Kent
109,Section_4,George Kent,"Five great-uncles served honorably in the Navy and the Army in World War II. In particular, Tom Taggart was stationed in the Philippines at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He survived the brutal Bataan Death March and three and a half years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp unbroken. He returned to service as an Air Force judge advocate, upholding the rule of law until his death in 1965. Today, I appear before you once again under subpoena as a fact witness ready to answer all of your questions about the events and developments examined in this inquiry to the best of my ability and recollection, subject to the limits placed on me by the law and this process. I will begin with some opening comments on the key principles at the heart of what brings me before you today, to wit, principled public service in pursuit of our enduring national interests and the place of Ukraine international and security interests.",01:04,Taylor/Kent
110,Section_4,George Kent,"For the past five years we have focused our united efforts across the Atlantic to support Ukraine in its fight for the cause of freedom and the rebirth of a country free from Russian dominion and the warped legacy of Soviet institutions and post-Soviet behavior. As I stated in my closed-door deposition last month, you don’t step into the public arena of international diplomacy in active pursuit of principled US interests without expecting vigorous pushback, including personal attacks. Such attacks came from the Russians, their proxies, and corrupt Ukrainians. That tells me our efforts were hitting their mark. It was unexpected and most unfortunate, however, to watch some Americans, including those who allied themselves with corrupt Ukrainians in pursuit of private agendas, launch attacks on dedicated public servants, advancing US interests in Ukraine. In my opinion, those attacks undermined US and Ukrainian national interests and damaged our critical bilateral relationship.",02:06,Taylor/Kent
111,Section_4,George Kent,"The United States has very clear national interests at stake in Ukraine. Ukraine’s success is very much in our national interest in the way we have defined our national interest broadly in Europe for the past 75 years. After World War II, US leadership furthered far-sighted policies like the Marshall Plan in the creation of a rules-based international order protected by the collective security provided by NATO. Western Europe recovered and thrived after the carnage of World War II, not withstanding the shadow of the Iron Curtain. Europe’s security and prosperity contributed to our security and prosperity. Support of Ukraine’s success also fits squarely into our strategy for Central and Eastern Europe since the fall of the wall 30 years ago this past week. A Europe truly whole, free, and at peace, our strategic game for the entirety of my foreign service career, is not possible without a Ukraine whole, free, and at peace, including Crimea and the Donbass, territories currently occupied by Russia, represented by the red in the map.",03:15,Taylor/Kent
112,Section_4,George Kent,"Looking forward, the Trump administration’s national security strategy makes clear the global strategic challenge now before us: great power competition with rivals such as Russia and China, and the need to compete for positive influence without taking countries for granted. In that sense, Ukraine has been on the front lines, not just of Russia’s conventional war in Eastern Europe since 2014 and its broader campaign of malign influence, but of the greater geopolitical challenges now facing the United States. Ukraine’s popular revolution of dignity in 2014 forced a corrupt, pro-Russian leadership to flee to Moscow. After that, Russia invaded Ukraine, occupying 7% of its territory, roughly equivalent to the size of Texas for the United States. At that time, Ukraine’s state institutions were on the verge of collapse. Ukrainian civil society answered the challenge. They formed volunteer battalions of citizens, including technology professionals and medics. They crowdsourced funding for their own weapons, body armor, and supplies.",04:26,Taylor/Kent
113,Section_4,George Kent,"They were the 21st century Ukrainian equivalent of our own Minutemen of 1776, buying time for a regular army to reconstitute. Since then, more than 13,000 Ukrainians have died on Ukrainian soil, defending their territorial integrity and sovereignty from Russian aggression. America’s support in Ukraine’s own de facto war of independence has been critical in this regard. By analogy, the American colonies may not have prevailed against the British imperial might without the help of transatlantic friends after 1776. In an echo of Lafayette’s organized assistance to General George Washington’s army and Admiral John Paul Jones’ navy, Congress has generously appropriated over $1.5 billion over the past five years, and desperately-needed trained and equipped security assistance to Ukraine. These funds increase Ukraine’s strength and ability to fight Russian aggression. Ultimately, Ukraine is on a path to become a full security partner of the United States within NATO. Similar to von Steuben training colonials at Valley Forge, US and NATO allied trainers develop the skills of Ukrainian units at Yavoriv, near the Polish border and elsewhere.",05:37,Taylor/Kent
114,Section_4,George Kent,"They help rewrite military education for Ukraine’s next generation, as von Steuben did for America’s first. In supporting Ukraine’s brave resistance to Russian aggression we have a front row seat to the Russian way of war in the 21st century, gaining priceless insights that contribute to our own security. This year, in 2019, Ukrainian citizens passed the political torch to a new generation, one that came of age not in the final years of the Soviet Union, but in an independent Ukraine. Presidential and parliamentary elections swept out much of Ukraine’s previous governing elite and seated 41-year-old President Zelensky, a cabinet with an average age of 39, and a parliament with the average age of 41.",06:52,Taylor/Kent
115,Section_4,George Kent,"At the heart of that change mandate, five years after Ukraine’s revolution of dignity, is a thirst for justice, because there cannot be dignity without justice. Without a reformed judicial sector that delivers justice with integrity for all, Ukrainian society will remain unsettled. Foreign investors, including American investors, will not bring the great investment needed to ensure that Ukraine’s long-term prosperity is secured. This is why the principled promotion of the rule of law and institutional integrity is so necessary to our strategy for a successful Ukraine. It is also true for other former captive nations still recovering from the ashes of Soviet and communist misrule. It is why acting inconsistently with the core principle of the rule of law comes at great peril. I am grateful to all of the members of Congress and staffers, including many of you sitting here today, who have traveled to Ukraine over the past five years and appropriated billions of dollars of assistance and support of our primary policy goals.",07:39,Taylor/Kent
116,Section_4,George Kent,"Those funds increase Ukraine’s ability to fight Russian aggression in the defense, energy, cyber, and information spheres. They also empower state institutions and civil society to undertake systemic reforms and tackle corruption. I believe all of us can be proud of our efforts in Ukraine over the past five years, even though much remains to be done. By all of us, I mean those of us in the legislative and the executive branches in both parties, the interagency community working out of our embassy in Kiev, with Ukrainians in government, the military, and civil society, and our transatlantic allies and partners. We cannot allow our resolve to waver, since too much is at stake, not just for Ukraine and the future of European security, but for the national interests of the United States broadly defined. My prior deposition covered a lot of ground over 10 hours. Here are the main 10 themes from my testimony.",08:42,Taylor/Kent
117,Section_4,George Kent,"I outlined my experience with longstanding US interest in supporting anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. This work gave me a front row seat to problematic activities by successive prosecutors general in Ukraine. For many of the issues this committee is investigating, my knowledge and understanding is sometimes firsthand and sometimes comes from others involved in specific conversations and meetings. This is no different than how anyone learns and carries out his or her job responsibilities. I have been and remain willing to share my factual observations with the committee and will make clear when those are based on personal knowledge or from information gleaned from others. US efforts to counter corruption in Ukraine focus on building institutional capacity so that the Ukrainian government has the ability to go after corruption and effectively investigate, prosecute, and judge alleged criminal activities using appropriate institutional mechanisms; that is, to create and follow the rule of law.",09:37,Taylor/Kent
118,Section_4,George Kent,"That means that if there are criminal nexuses for activity in the United States, US law enforcement should pursue the case. If we think there’s been a criminal act overseas that violates US law, we have the institutional mechanisms to address that. It could be through the justice department and FBI agents assigned overseas, or through treaty mechanisms such as the mutual legal assistance treaty. As a general principle, I do not believe the United States should ask other countries to engage in selective, politically-associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents of those in power, because such selective actions undermine the rule of law, regardless of the country. The pervasive and longstanding problem of corruption in Ukraine included exposure to a situation involving the energy company Burisma. The primary concern of the US government since 2014 was Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, whose frozen assets abroad we had attempted to recover on Ukraine’s behalf. In early 2015 I raised questions with the deputy prosecutor general about why the investigation of Mr. Zlochevsky had been terminated, based on our belief that prosecutors had accepted bribes to close the case.",10:38,Taylor/Kent
119,Section_4,George Kent,"Later, I became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma. Soon after that, in a briefing call with the national security staff of the office of the vice president in February of 2015, I raised my concern that Hunter Biden’s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest. Let me be clear, however: I did not witness any effort by any US official to shield Burisma from scrutiny. In fact, I and other US officials consistently advocated re-instituting a scuttled investigation of Zlochevsky, Burisma’s founder, as well as holding the corrupt prosecutors who closed the case to account. Over the course of 2018 and 2019 I became increasingly aware of an effort by Rudy Giuliani and others, including his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, to run a campaign to smear Ambassador Yovanovitch and other officials at the US embassy in Kiev.",11:51,Taylor/Kent
120,Section_4,George Kent,"The chief agitators on the Ukrainian side of this effort were some of those same corrupt former prosecutors I had encountered, particularly [inaudible 00:12:50] and Viktor Shoken. They were now peddling false information in order to extract revenge against those who had exposed their misconduct, including US diplomats, Ukrainian anti-corruption officials, and reform-minded civil society groups in Ukraine. During the late spring and summer of 2019 I became alarmed as those efforts bore fruit. They led to the ouster of Ambassador Yovanovitch and hampered US efforts to establish rapport with the new Zelensky administration in Ukraine. In mid-August it became clear to me that Giuliani’s efforts to gin up politically-motivated investigations were now infecting US engagement with Ukraine, leveraging President Zelensky’s desire for a White House meeting. There are and always have been conditionality placed on our sovereign loan guarantees for Ukraine. Conditions include anti-corruption reforms, as well as meeting larger stability goals and social safety nets.",12:42,Taylor/Kent
121,Section_4,George Kent,"The International Monetary Fund does the same thing. Congress and the executive branch work together to put conditionality on some security assistance in the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. Regarding my testimony today I will do my best to answer your questions; questions that will involve issues, conversations, and documents that span a number of years. I may be limited by three considerations. First, the state department has collected all materials in response to the September 27th subpoena that may contain facts relevant to my testimony. I have no such documents or materials with me today. I will thus do my best to answer as accurately, completely, and truthfully as I can to the best of my recollection. Second, as this committee knows from deposition testimony, throughout this process there have been concerns that questions may be asked about classified information.",13:44,Taylor/Kent
122,Section_4,George Kent,"We have asked the State Department for guidance about classification concerns related to the public release of my deposition, and the State Department has declined to provide any. So, if I’m asked a question today that I believe may implicate classified information, I will respectfully decline to answer in this public forum. Third, there may be questions focusing on the identity of people in the intelligence community. These questions were redacted from my deposition’s transcript. If such a question arises today, I will follow my council’s advice and decline to answer. I would like to conclude my opening remarks with an observation about some of my fellow public servants who have come under personal attacks: Ambassador Yovanovicth, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, and Dr. Hill, at least one of whom is going to appear before this body in the coming days. Masha, Alex, and Fiona were born abroad before their families or they, themselves, personally chose to immigrate to the United States. They all made the professional choice to serve the United States as public officials, helping shape our national security policy towards Russia in particular, and we and our national security are the better for it.",14:34,Taylor/Kent
123,Section_4,George Kent,"In this sense, they are the 21st century heirs of two giants of 20th century US national security policy, who also were born abroad: my former professors Zbigniew Brzezinski and his fellow immigrant Henry Kissinger. Like the Brzezinskis and Kissingers, the Yovanovitches and Vindmans fled Nazi and communist oppression to contribute to a stronger, more secure America. That honorable tradition of transatlantic ties goes back to the very founding of our republic. Our 18th century independence would not have been secured without the choice of European officers: the French-born Lafayette and Rochambeau, the German-born von Steuben, and the Poles Pulaski and Kosciuszko to come to the New World and fight for our cause of freedom and the birth of a new country free from imperial dominion. It is my privilege to sit next to my former boss, Ambassador Taylor, today, and it is my honor to serve with all of these patriotic Americans. Thank you.",15:44,Taylor/Kent
124,Section_4,Adam Schiff,"[crosstalk 00:00:00] Ambassador Taylor, I’d like to begin by following up on something that you have disclosed today, and you disclosed earlier to both majority and minority, but it is some new information for the committee. You said in your testimony that one of your staff was present with Ambassador Sondland on the day after the July 25th phone call. Is that right?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
125,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"That’s correct, Mr. Chairman.",00:26,Taylor/Kent
126,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"And as your staff related the event to you, your staff member could overhear Mr. Sondland on the phone … well, could overhear the President on the phone with Mr. Sondland, is that right?",00:28,Taylor/Kent
127,Section_5,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,00:39,Taylor/Kent
128,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"So the President must’ve been speaking loud enough on the phone … this was a cellphone, I take it?",00:41,Taylor/Kent
129,Section_5,Bill Taylor,It was a cellphone.,00:46,Taylor/Kent
130,Section_5,Adam Schiff,The President must’ve been speaking loud enough for your staff member to be able to overhear this?,00:47,Taylor/Kent
131,Section_5,Bill Taylor,It was.,00:53,Taylor/Kent
132,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"And what your staff member could overhear was President Trump asking Ambassador Sondland about, “The investigations.” Is that right?",00:55,Taylor/Kent
133,Section_5,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,01:04,Taylor/Kent
134,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"I think you testified also that you had come to understand that the term investigations was a term that Ambassador Sondland, as well as Volker used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections and to the investigations of Burisma and the Bidens. Is that correct?",01:05,Taylor/Kent
135,Section_5,Bill Taylor,That is correct. Mr. Chairman.,01:23,Taylor/Kent
136,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"So your staff member overhears the President asking about the investigations, meaning Burisma and the Bidens in 2016, and Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward?",01:25,Taylor/Kent
137,Section_5,Bill Taylor,He did.,01:37,Taylor/Kent
138,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"And I think you said that after the call when your staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought of Ukraine, his response was that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden. Is that right?",01:40,Taylor/Kent
139,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"And Burisma, yes sir.",01:53,Taylor/Kent
140,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And I take it the end part of that is he cares more about that than he does about Ukraine.,01:58,Taylor/Kent
141,Section_5,Bill Taylor,Yes sir.,02:03,Taylor/Kent
142,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"During your testimony, Ambassador Taylor, you also said that more Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without US assistance. Why is that?",02:12,Taylor/Kent
143,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Chairman, the security assistance that we provide takes many forms. One of the components of that assistance is counter-battery radar. Another component are sniper weapons. These weapons and this assistance allows the Ukrainian military to deter further incursions by the Russians against Ukrainian territory. If that further incursion, further aggression were to take place, more Ukrainians would die. So it is a deterrent effect that these weapons provide. It’s also the ability … it gives the Ukranians the ability to negotiate from a position of a little more strength when they negotiate an end to the war in Donbass, negotiating with the Russians. This also is a way that would reduce the number of Ukrainians who would die.",02:22,Taylor/Kent
144,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"I take it if the provision of US military assistance would save Ukrainian lives, lives that any delay in that assistance may also cost Ukrainian lives. Is that true?",03:32,Taylor/Kent
145,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Chairman, of course it’s hard to draw any direct lines between any particular element of security systems and any particular death on the battlefield, but it is certainly true that that assistance had enabled Ukrainian armed forces to be effective and deter and to be able to take countermeasures to the attacks that the Russians had [crosstalk 00:04:08]-",03:44,Taylor/Kent
146,Section_5,Adam Schiff,I think you said that a Ukrainian soldier lost their life while you were visiting Donbass.,04:08,Taylor/Kent
147,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"We keep very careful track of the casualties and I noticed on the next day, information that we got that one was killed, four soldiers were wounded on that day.",04:13,Taylor/Kent
148,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And indeed Ukrainians lose their lives every week?,04:26,Taylor/Kent
149,Section_5,Bill Taylor,Every week.,04:30,Taylor/Kent
150,Section_5,Adam Schiff,I think you also testified that Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American support for the Ukrainian government. Why is that significant?,04:34,Taylor/Kent
151,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"This is significant, Mr. Chairman, because the Ukrainians in particular under this new administration are eager to end this war and they are eager to end it in a way that the Russians leave their territory. These negotiations, like all negotiations, are difficult. Ukrainians would like to be able to negotiate from a position of strength or at least more strength than they now have.",04:43,Taylor/Kent
152,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"Part of that strength, part of the ability of the Ukrainians to negotiate against the Russians with the Russians for an end to the war in Donbass depends on the United States and other international support. If we withdraw, or suspend, or threatened to withdraw our security systems, that’s a message to the Ukrainians. But it’s at least as important as your question indicates, Mr. Chairman, to the Russians who are looking for any sign of weakness or any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine.",05:14,Taylor/Kent
153,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"And so when the Ukrainians learned of the suspension of the military aid, either privately or when others learned publicly, the Russians would be learning also and they would take that as a lack of robust US support for Ukraine. Is that right?",05:48,Taylor/Kent
154,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"That’s correct, sir.",06:07,Taylor/Kent
155,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And that would weaken Ukraine in negotiating an end to the war in Donbass?,06:08,Taylor/Kent
156,Section_5,Bill Taylor,It would.,06:14,Taylor/Kent
157,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"People watching I’m sure are interested in how military assistance and diplomatic support for Ukraine effects Ukraine, but even more so interested in how does this effect our national security. Now, I think you said that if we believe in a principle of sovereignty of nations where countries get to determine their own economic political and security alliances, we have to support Ukraine and its fight, that the kind of aggression we see by Russia can’t stand. How is it important to American national security that we provide for a robust defense of Ukraine sovereign?",06:16,Taylor/Kent
158,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Chairman, as my colleague, Deputy Secretary George Kent described, we have a national security policy, a national defense policy that identifies Russia and China as adversaries. The Russians are violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings that they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for nearly 70 years. Until they invaded Ukraine in 2014, they had abided by sovereignty of nations, of inviability of borders.",06:59,Taylor/Kent
159,Section_5,Bill Taylor,"That rule of law, that order that kept the peace in Europe and allowed for prosperity as well as peace in Europe was violated by the Russians. And if we don’t push back on that, on those violations, then that will continue. And that, Mr. Chairman, effects us. It effects the world that we live in, that our children will grow up in, that our grandchildren … this affects the kind of world that we want to see overall. So that effects our national interest very directly. Ukraine is on the front line of that conflict.",07:43,Taylor/Kent
160,Section_5,Adam Schiff,I want to thank you both for your decades of service to the country and I’ll now recognize Mr. Goldman for questioning.,08:25,Taylor/Kent
161,Section_5,Devin Nunes,"The call summary for which the Democrats want to impeach President Trump is dramatically different from their nefarious depiction of it. What it actually shows is a pleasant exchange between two leaders who discuss mutual cooperation over a range of issues. The Democrats claim this call demonstrates extortion, bribery, and a host of other monstrous crimes being committed against President Zelensky. Yet President Zelensky himself insists there was nothing improper whatsoever about the conversation.",00:00,Taylor/Kent
162,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Indeed, the routine nature of the call helps to explain why in this committee’s last public hearing, Democrats recited a fictitious version of the call. Instead of reading the actual transcript, the Democrats depicted the President saying, quote, “I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it. On this and on that,” unquote. The transcript did not show President Trump saying anything remotely like that. The President did not ask Ukraine to make up dirt on anyone. But the Democrats are not trying to discover facts, they’re trying to invent a narrative. And if the facts they need do not exist, then they’ll just make it up.",00:34,Taylor/Kent
163,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Not only does President Zelensky deny the Democrats’ characterization of the call, but as Ambassador Taylor testified to this committee, the Ukrainians did not even know at the time of the call that a temporary delay was put on the security assistance for them. Furthermore, as the Ambassador testified, these holds occur from time to time. Both he and Ambassador Volker were confident the delay would be lifted. In fact, military aid to Ukraine has actually substantially improved since President Trump took office.",01:23,Taylor/Kent
164,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Ambassador Taylor testified that President Trump was the first president to see that Ukraine was afforded Javelin anti-tank weapons. This was a very strong message that Americans are willing to provide more than blankets. This was the Obama Administration’s approach.,02:00,Taylor/Kent
165,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Note this important fact, the security assistance was provided to Ukraine without the Ukrainians having done any of the things they were supposedly being blackmailed to do. So we’re supposed to believe that President Trump committed a terrible crime that never actually occurred, and which the supposed victim denies ever happened.",02:17,Taylor/Kent
166,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"I’d like to briefly speak about the core mistruth at the heart of the Democrats’ impeachment drive. They claim the President tried to get the Ukrainians to quote, “manufacture dirt against his political rivals.” This is supported by precisely zero evidence. Once again, the Democrats simply made it up.",02:42,Taylor/Kent
167,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"But let’s consider the broader question about why President Trump may have wanted answers to questions about Ukraine meddling in 2016. The Democrats downplay, ignore, outright deny the many indications that Ukrainians actually did meddle in the election. A shocking about-face for people who for three years argued that foreign election meddling was an intolerable crime that threatened the heart of our democracy.",03:04,Taylor/Kent
168,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"While the brazen suddenness of this U-turn is jarring, this denial is a necessary part of their argument. After all, if there actually were indications of Ukraine election meddling and if foreign election meddling is a dire threat, then President Trump would have a perfectly good reason for wanting to find out what happened. And since the meddling was aimed against his campaign, he’d have good reason for sending his personal attorney to make inquiries about it.",03:33,Taylor/Kent
169,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"What’s strange is that some of the witnesses at these hearings and previous depositions, who express alarm about these inquiries, were remarkably uninformed about these indications of Ukrainian election meddling, and why the President may have been concerned by them. For example, I noted previously, Alexandra Chalupa, former staffer for the Democratic National Committee, admitted to Politico that she worked with officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, DC to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign, which she passed on to the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Chalupa revealed that Ukrainian embassy officials themselves were also working directly with reporters to trade information and leads about the Trump campaign.",04:05,Taylor/Kent
170,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Ambassador Kent, you didn’t seem to be too concerned about it in the last round of questioning, so I’ll just skip you because we know that wasn’t a concern. But Ambassador Taylor, you testified to this committee that you only recently became aware of reports of this cooperation between Ukrainian embassy officials and Chalupa to undermine the Trump campaign from your last deposition. Is that correct?",04:54,Taylor/Kent
171,Section_6,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Nunes, it is correct that I had not known about this before.",05:21,Taylor/Kent
172,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Yes. I’m just going over your last deposition-,05:25,Taylor/Kent
173,Section_6,Bill Taylor,Exactly right.,05:27,Taylor/Kent
174,Section_6,Devin Nunes,… Ambassador.,05:27,Taylor/Kent
175,Section_6,Bill Taylor,Yeah.,05:28,Taylor/Kent
176,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"The Politico article cites three named Ukrainian officials asserting that the Ukrainian embassy supported the Hillary Clinton campaign. It quotes Ukrainian parliamentarian, Andrey Artemenko, saying quote, “It was clear they were supporting Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. They did everything from organizing meetings with the Clinton team, to publicly supporting her, to criticizing Trump. I think that they simply didn’t meet with the Trump campaign because they thought Hillary would win,” unquote.",05:29,Taylor/Kent
177,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Ambassador Taylor, you testified you were unfamiliar with that statement. Is that correct?",05:59,Taylor/Kent
178,Section_6,Bill Taylor,That is correct.,06:03,Taylor/Kent
179,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"You also said you were unaware that then Ukrainian ambassador to the US, Valeriy Chaly, wrote an op-ed in The Hill during the 2016 presidential campaign criticizing then candidate Trump. Is that correct?",06:05,Taylor/Kent
180,Section_6,Bill Taylor,That is correct.,06:20,Taylor/Kent
181,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"You said you did not know that Serhiy Leshchenko, then a Ukrainian parliamentarian, had admitted that part of his motivation and spreading information about the so-called “black ledger,” a disputed document purporting to reveal corruption by a former Trump campaign official, was to undermine the Trump’s candidacy. This was in your deposition. Is that still correct?",06:22,Taylor/Kent
182,Section_6,Bill Taylor,"That is still correct, sir.",06:45,Taylor/Kent
183,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Thank you, Mr. Taylor.",06:46,Taylor/Kent
184,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Fusion GPS contractor, Nellie Ohr, testified to Congress that Leshchenko was a source for Fusion GPS’s operation to dirty up the Trump campaign. Including the compilation of the Steele dossier, on behalf of the DNC and the Clinton campaign.",06:48,Taylor/Kent
185,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"You testified you were unaware that Leshchenko served as a source for that project. Ambassador Taylor, is this still correct?",07:05,Taylor/Kent
186,Section_6,Bill Taylor,"It is, sir.",07:13,Taylor/Kent
187,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"You said you did not know that Ukrainian Internal Affairs minister, Arsen Avakov, mocked and disparaged then candidate Trump on Facebook and Twitter. Is that still correct?",07:17,Taylor/Kent
188,Section_6,Bill Taylor,That is correct.,07:30,Taylor/Kent
189,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Ambassador Taylor, in your testimony to this committee, you said you were never briefed on these reports and statements. That you did not do due diligence before taking your post to discover the President’s and Mayor Giuliani’s concerns, what they may have been, and that you did not discuss them with Ambassador Yovanovitch. Is that still correct?",07:32,Taylor/Kent
190,Section_6,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",07:55,Taylor/Kent
191,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Furthermore, you said it upset you to hear about the many indications of Ukrainian election meddling. Your precise words were, I’m going to read them back to you, “Based on this Politico article, which again, surprises me, disappoints me because I think it’s a mistake for any diplomat or government official in one country to interfere in the political life of another. That’s disappointing,” unquote. Ambassador Taylor, is that still your testimony?",07:57,Taylor/Kent
192,Section_6,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Nunes, it is. Subsequent to that, I looked into the circumstances for several of the things that you just mentioned. In 2016, candidate Trump had made a statement saying that it was possible that he would allow Crimea to go back to Russia. He expressed the sentiment or the opinion that it’s possible that Crimea wanted to go back to Russia. What I can tell you, Mr. Nunes, is that that sentiment is amazingly inflammatory to all Ukrainians. So-",08:25,Taylor/Kent
193,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"So I can understand that. Are you aware during the… I believe it was the 2012 election when, at the time, President Obama leaned over on a hot mic to the then Russian president and said that he’d have to wait until after the election. Was that inflammatory to the Ukrainians also?",09:26,Taylor/Kent
194,Section_6,Bill Taylor,"I don’t know, sir.",09:51,Taylor/Kent
195,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"I just want to be clear that some government officials opposed President Trump’s approach to Ukraine, but many had no idea what concerned him. In this case, it was numerous indications of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election to oppose his campaign and support Hillary Clinton. Once you know that, it’s easy to understand the President’s desire to get to the bottom of this corruption and to discover exactly what happened in the 2016 election.",09:57,Taylor/Kent
196,Section_6,Adam Schiff,"I will now move to five minute member rounds. I recognize myself for five minutes. Mr. Kent, I want to follow up on my colleague’s questions regarding Burisma. You testified about a time when an oligarch named Zlochevsky, I think it was, was self-dealing awarding himself contracts. When was that?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
197,Section_7,George Kent,"To the best of my knowledge, he was minister of energy, sorry, minister of ecology under President Yanukovych, from 2010 to 2012. And at the time, licenses to have substrata exploration of gas were awarded by subdivision of the ministry of ecology.",00:23,Taylor/Kent
198,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"So this corrupt self-dealing then was approximately seven years, at least seven years before the events that bring us here today, the phone call on the 25th and the events around it?",00:41,Taylor/Kent
199,Section_7,George Kent,Correct. His time as minister was 2010 to 2012. Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014.,00:53,Taylor/Kent
200,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"And you’ve read the call transcript, have you not?",01:01,Taylor/Kent
201,Section_7,George Kent,"I have and I have it in front of me, but I haven’t read it for about a month.",01:04,Taylor/Kent
202,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"Is there any mention in the discussion with President Trump and President Zelensky of this oligarch, Zlochevsky, who seven years earlier had been self-dealing?",01:08,Taylor/Kent
203,Section_7,George Kent,"To the best of my knowledge, no.",01:18,Taylor/Kent
204,Section_7,Adam Schiff,Is there a discussion of awarding contracts to oneself or the corrupt acts in the 2012 to 2014 timeframe?,01:20,Taylor/Kent
205,Section_7,George Kent,"To the best of my knowledge, no.",01:31,Taylor/Kent
206,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"What the President brings up is CrowdStrike, the server, and the Bidens? Am I right?",01:34,Taylor/Kent
207,Section_7,George Kent,"I see that here, yes.",01:40,Taylor/Kent
208,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"There was no discussion on that call of setting up an anti-corruption court or looking into corruption among oligarchs or companies in general. The President’s comments were focused on two things, 2016 and the Bidens, am I right?",01:43,Taylor/Kent
209,Section_7,George Kent,"I believe so, yes.",01:59,Taylor/Kent
210,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"Now, you testified in your opening statement, “I do not believe the United States should ask other countries to engage in selective politically associated investigations or prosecutions against the opponents of those in power. Because such selective actions undermine the rule of law regardless of the country.” The selective politically associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents of those in power are you referring to the Bidens, there?",02:01,Taylor/Kent
211,Section_7,George Kent,I’m referring as a general principle about the promotion of the rule of law.,02:26,Taylor/Kent
212,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"But that would apply to the President of United States seeking an investigation of his political opponent, would it not?",02:30,Taylor/Kent
213,Section_7,George Kent,"It could be interpreted that way, yes sir.",02:35,Taylor/Kent
214,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"And I take it in your discussions, Ambassador Taylor, with Ambassador Sondland or others, what was communicated to you was that the President wanted investigations into 2016 and the Bidens, not into an oligarch named Zlochevsky or self-dealing, but 2016 and the Bidens, was that your understanding?",02:38,Taylor/Kent
215,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That was my understanding.,03:04,Taylor/Kent
216,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"And in fact, when you said your staff overheard this call between Ambassador Sondland and the President, in that call, the President brings up investigation, does he not?",03:06,Taylor/Kent
217,Section_7,Bill Taylor,He did.,03:20,Taylor/Kent
218,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"And immediately after the President gets off the phone with Sondland, Sondland is asked by your staff, “What does the President think about Ukraine?” And his answer is, “He’s just interested in the Bidens.” Am I right?",03:21,Taylor/Kent
219,Section_7,Bill Taylor,He said he was more interested in the Bidens.,03:34,Taylor/Kent
220,Section_7,Adam Schiff,More interested in the Bidens. No discussion of Zlochevsky or Chalupa or things that happened seven years ago. He was interested in the Bidens?,03:37,Taylor/Kent
221,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Yes sir.,03:49,Taylor/Kent
222,Section_7,Adam Schiff,Now I think you also testified that Ambassador Sondland told you that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Is that right?,03:50,Taylor/Kent
223,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Yes sir.,04:02,Taylor/Kent
224,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"And by public box did that mean that private statements, private promises to do this investigation of 2016 or the Bidens were not enough, he had to go on T.V., he had to go public in some way because the President wanted him in that box. Is that your understanding?",04:03,Taylor/Kent
225,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Chairman, I don’t know exactly what he had in mind and I’m not sure what Ambassador Sondland had in mind, who was the one who mentioned that to me, that’s the implication. The implication was it needed to be public as opposed to being a private assurance.",04:19,Taylor/Kent
226,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"And I think you said in that same call you asked Ambassador Sondland to push back on President Trump’s demand, is that right?",04:37,Taylor/Kent
227,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"That’s correct, sir.",04:48,Taylor/Kent
228,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"So you understood from your conversation with Sondland, this was the President’s demand, not Sondland’s demand, the President’s demand, and you wanted Sondland to push back, am I right?",04:49,Taylor/Kent
229,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"So Ambassador Sondland was clearly able to have conversations with the President. And I thought that the pressure on a another president, on President Zelensky, was not a good idea from either president’s standpoint. So I suggested in that phone call with Ambassador Sondland that he, since he regularly or frequently had conversations with the President could make that point.",04:59,Taylor/Kent
230,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"Well, and I think the way you expressed yourself is, you wanted Sondland to push back on President Trump’s demand, right?",05:32,Taylor/Kent
231,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Yes sir.,05:38,Taylor/Kent
232,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"So it was your understand from talking to Sondland, this is what the President wanted him to do and you wanted Sondland to push back?",05:38,Taylor/Kent
233,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I asked Ambassador Sondland to push back, that’s correct.",05:45,Taylor/Kent
234,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"And in fact, even after the aide was ultimately released, even after the White House learns of the whistleblower complaint and the congressional investigation, the aid is released. Even after those events, you are still worried that Zelensky was going to feel it necessary to go on CNN and announce these investigations, were you not?",05:49,Taylor/Kent
235,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Chairman, I was still worried that he might do that. So yes, I thought that would be a bad idea. And so when there was some indication that there might still be a plan for the CNN interview in New York, which was upcoming, at the United Nations general assembly meeting, I was worried … I wanted to be sure that that didn’t happen so I addressed it with Zelensky’s staff.",06:10,Taylor/Kent
236,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"And I think you said earlier that Danylyuk, the national security advisor then for Zelensky, was concerned Zelensky didn’t want to be used as some tool in American politics, is that right?",06:34,Taylor/Kent
237,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"That’s correct, sir.",06:45,Taylor/Kent
238,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"So Zelenksy didn’t want to go on T.V. to announce political investigations that he thought would mire him in U.S. politics, right?",06:47,Taylor/Kent
239,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"He and his advisors knew that it’s a bad idea to interject, to interfere in other nation’s elections, yes, sir.",06:54,Taylor/Kent
240,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"But nonetheless, it appeared until the aid was lifted, the hold was lifted, that he felt compelled to do it.",07:04,Taylor/Kent
241,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"He was making plans, his staff was making plans to have him make some kind of announcement. I don’t know what it would have been, on CNN, in public.",07:11,Taylor/Kent
242,Section_7,Adam Schiff,Even though he didn’t want to be mired in U.S. politics?,07:21,Taylor/Kent
243,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Even though he knew it was a bad idea to interfere in other people’s elections.,07:24,Taylor/Kent
244,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Ambassador Taylor, on the heels of you discussing the importance of the security assistance to Ukraine, I want to go to the end of the timeline where you learned that security assistance was conditioned on Ukraine announcing the investigations that the president wanted. And in particular on September 9th of this year, you texted Ambassador Sondland and Volker. And the text message should be on the screen in front of you. And if you could read what you wrote.",00:01,Taylor/Kent
245,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.",00:35,Taylor/Kent
246,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,What did you mean when you said you thought it was crazy?,00:44,Taylor/Kent
247,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr.Goldman, I meant that because of the importance of security assistance that we had just described and had a conversation with the chairman, because that was so important. That security system was so important for Ukraine, as well as our own national interest, to withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with the political campaign made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.",00:48,Taylor/Kent
248,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"When you say all of what we were trying to do, what do you mean by we?",01:29,Taylor/Kent
249,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I mean that the United States was trying to support Ukraine as a frontline state against Russian attack. And again, the whole notion of a rules based order was being threatened by the Russians in Ukraine. So our security assistance was designed to support Ukraine. It was not just the United States, it was all of our allies.",01:33,Taylor/Kent
250,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"When you reference help with a political campaign and it’s in this text message, what did you mean?",01:58,Taylor/Kent
251,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I meant that the investigation of Burisma and the Bidens was clearly identified by Mr. Giuliani in public four months as a way to get information on the two Bidens.,02:04,Taylor/Kent
252,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And that investigation at the very least was mentioned by president Trump in the July 25th phone call with President Zelensky, is that right?",02:25,Taylor/Kent
253,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"As we now know? Yes. On September 25th, that transcript was released.",02:34,Taylor/Kent
254,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Ambassador Taylor, in your decades of military service and diplomatic service representing the United States around the world, have you ever seen another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the president of the United States?",02:40,Taylor/Kent
255,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"No. Mr Goldman, I’ve not.",02:59,Taylor/Kent
256,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Mr. Kent, that vital military assistance that was not the only thing that President Trump was withholding from Ukraine. What else was contingent on Ukraine initiating these investigations?",03:02,Taylor/Kent
257,Section_7,George Kent,"Well, as we’ve talked earlier today, the possibility of a White House meeting was being held contingent to an announcement.",03:16,Taylor/Kent
258,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,How important to President Zelensky was a White House meeting?,03:25,Taylor/Kent
259,Section_7,George Kent,"New leaders, particularly countries that are trying to have good footing in the international arena, see a meeting with the US president in the oval office at the White House as the ultimate sign of endorsement and support from the United States.",03:30,Taylor/Kent
260,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And President Zelensky was a relatively new president, is that right?",03:49,Taylor/Kent
261,Section_7,George Kent,That’s correct. He was elected on April 21st and his government was formed after parliamentary elections in July.,03:53,Taylor/Kent
262,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Would a White House meeting for President Zelensky boost his legitimacy as a new president in Ukraine?,04:01,Taylor/Kent
263,Section_7,George Kent,It would primarily boost his leverage to negotiate with Vladimir Putin about the Russian occupation of 7% of Ukrainian territory.,04:07,Taylor/Kent
264,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Mr. Ken, is pressuring Ukraine to conduct what I believe you’ve called political investigations, a part of US foreign policy to promote the rule of law in Ukraine and around the world?",04:16,Taylor/Kent
265,Section_7,George Kent,It is not.,04:29,Taylor/Kent
266,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Is it in the national interest of the United States?,04:31,Taylor/Kent
267,Section_7,George Kent,"In my opinion, it is not.",04:34,Taylor/Kent
268,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Why not?,04:36,Taylor/Kent
269,Section_7,George Kent,"Because our policies, particularly in promoting the rule of law, are designed to help countries, and in Eastern Europe and central Europe, that is overcoming the legacy of communism. In the communist system in particular, the prosecutor general office was used to suppress and persecute citizens, not promote the rule of law. So in helping these countries reach their own aspirations to join the Western community of nations and live lives of dignity, helping them have the rule of law with strong institutions is the purpose of our policy.",04:37,Taylor/Kent
270,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"So in other words, it is a purpose of our foreign policy to encourage foreign nations to refrain from conducting political investigations. Is that right?",05:13,Taylor/Kent
271,Section_7,George Kent,"Correct. And in fact, as a matter of policy not of programming, we oftentimes raise our concerns usually in private with countries that we feel are engaged in selective political prosecution and persecution of their opponents.",05:24,Taylor/Kent
272,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Ambassador Taylor, now that we’ve established that you ultimately did understand that President Trump was withholding the security assistance in a White House meeting from Ukraine until they announced these investigations to benefit his reelection campaign. Let’s go back a little bit in time to when you first learned about this conditionality. And on September 1st, so a little more than a week before that text we just read, you sent another text to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, which should also beyond the screen in front of you. And if you could read what you wrote to them.",05:39,Taylor/Kent
273,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Are we now saying that security assistance and White House meeting are conditioned on investigations?,06:19,Taylor/Kent
274,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And Ambassador Sondland responded, “Call me.” Now, what information had you learned that prompted you to write this text message?",06:27,Taylor/Kent
275,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I had learned that in Warsaw after the meeting Vice President Pence had with President Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland, I had had meetings there. And had described to Mr. Yamak, the assistant to President Zelensky, that the security assistance was also held pending announcement by President Zelensky in public of these investigations. Before that, I had only understood from Ambassador Sondland that the White House meeting was conditioned. And at this time, after I heard of this conversation, it struck me. It was clear to me that security systems was also being held.",06:43,Taylor/Kent
276,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,You said previously that you were alarmed to learn this. Why were you alarmed?,07:45,Taylor/Kent
277,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"It’s one thing to try to leverage a meeting in the White House. It’s another thing I thought to leverage security assistance, security assistance to a country at war, dependent on both the security assistance and the demonstration of support. It was much more alarming. The White House meeting was one thing. Security assistance was much more alarming.",07:53,Taylor/Kent
278,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now Ambassador Taylor, you in your opening statement, you outlined a very detailed timeline and in fact we have a written copy here and you included some phrases and words in quotations. Did you take notes of this conversation on September 1st with Ambassador Sondland?",08:31,Taylor/Kent
279,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I did.,08:50,Taylor/Kent
280,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Did you take notes related to most of the conversations, if not all of them, that you recited in your opening statement?",08:51,Taylor/Kent
281,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"All of them, Mr. Goldman",08:57,Taylor/Kent
282,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,What are those quotations that you include in your opening statement reflect?,09:00,Taylor/Kent
283,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"They reflect my notes on the exact words that I heard on that call, so it was… If I put those in quotes, that meant that those are the words used on that phone call or in that conversation.",09:05,Taylor/Kent
284,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did you review those notes before you drafted your opening statement and came here to testify again?,09:21,Taylor/Kent
285,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I did.,09:26,Taylor/Kent
286,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now is that how, for example, you remember that Ambassador Sondland was on a train from Paris to London during a call in July?",09:27,Taylor/Kent
287,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,09:37,Taylor/Kent
288,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And you are aware, I presume, that the state department has not provided those notes to the committee, is that right?",09:38,Taylor/Kent
289,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I am aware.,09:45,Taylor/Kent
290,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,So we don’t have the benefit of reviewing them to ask you these questions.,09:46,Taylor/Kent
291,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Correct. I understand that they may be coming sooner or later.,09:50,Taylor/Kent
292,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Well, we would welcome that.",09:54,Taylor/Kent
293,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"You also testified earlier Ambassador Taylor, that President Trump had delegated some matters overseeing Ukraine policy to Ambassador Sondland, who was a big inaugural supporter of President Trump, even though Ukraine is not in his domain of the European Union. Is that right?",09:56,Taylor/Kent
294,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Several participants in the meeting, in the oval office with President Trump, with the delegation to the inauguration of President Zelensky, told me of that conversation. And it was at that meeting, as I understand it from several participants, that President Trump asked the participants to work with Mr. Giuliani on Ukraine policy.",10:23,Taylor/Kent
295,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did you come to understand that Ambassador Sondland had a direct line of communication into President Trump?,10:52,Taylor/Kent
296,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I did.,10:59,Taylor/Kent
297,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And you testified, or rather in that text message, Ambassador Sondland says to call him after you wrote that. Did you in fact call him?",11:01,Taylor/Kent
298,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I did.,11:11,Taylor/Kent
299,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And what did he say to you?,11:12,Taylor/Kent
300,Section_7,Bill Taylor,He said that I was wrong about President Trump’s intent. That there was no quid pro quo.,11:14,Taylor/Kent
301,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"But did he say anything after that? Did he describe to you? I believe you said, I’ll refresh your memory, that you mentioned something in your opening statement, you said that he said that everything, and you had that in quotes, was actually contingent on the initiation of these investigations. What did he mean by everything?",11:27,Taylor/Kent
302,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Goldman, what he meant by everything was the security assistance and the White House meeting.",11:49,Taylor/Kent
303,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And I believe you also testified that he said he had made a mistake in relaying a message to the Ukrainians. What was that mistake?,12:00,Taylor/Kent
304,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mistake, he told me, was earlier he had told presumably President Zelensky and Mr.Yamak that what was necessary for the White House meeting was the pursuit of these investigations and he said he recognized that that was a mistake. It was not just the White House meeting that was dependent on the investigations. He said it was now everything, it included the security assistance.",12:09,Taylor/Kent
305,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"So it was not just the White House meeting, it was also the security assistance.",12:42,Taylor/Kent
306,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Yes sir.,12:45,Taylor/Kent
307,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And so even though President Trump was saying repeatedly that there is no quid pro quo, Ambassador Sondland relayed to you that the facts of the matter were that the White House meeting and the security assistance were conditioned on the announcement of these investigations.",12:46,Taylor/Kent
308,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Assistants were conditioned on the announcement of these investigations. Is that your understanding?,13:03,Taylor/Kent
309,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s my understanding.,13:05,Taylor/Kent
310,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, you reference a television interview and a desire for President Trump to put Zelensky in a public box, which you also have in quotes. Was that in your notes?",13:08,Taylor/Kent
311,Section_7,Bill Taylor,It was in my notes.,13:24,Taylor/Kent
312,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"What did you understand that to mean, to put Zelensky in a public box?",13:25,Taylor/Kent
313,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I understood that to mean that President Trump through Ambassador Sondland was asking for President Zelensky to very publicly commit to these investigations, that it was not sufficient to do this in private, that this needed to be a very public statement.",13:31,Taylor/Kent
314,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And did you understand why it was needed to be in public? As opposed to a private confirmation?,13:53,Taylor/Kent
315,Section_7,Bill Taylor,No further information on that.,13:59,Taylor/Kent
316,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, during this time period in early September, did you come to understand that from your conversations with the Ukrainians or other individuals that Ukraine felt pressure to initiate these investigations because of the conditionality of the White House meeting and the security assistance?",14:02,Taylor/Kent
317,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Goldman here’s what I know. I got several questions. Other officials got several questions as well from Ukrainians asking about the security assistance. So what I know is the security assistance was very important to the Ukrainians. They had begun to hear from Ambassador Sondland that the security systems was not going to come until the investigations were pursued. What I heard from the defense minister, what the senators, what Senator Johnson and Senator Murphy heard in their conversation with President Zelensky was the clear concern, the urgent concern that the Ukrainians had about the security assistance.",14:23,Taylor/Kent
318,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now you also described a conversation that you had with Ambassador Sondland, a week later on September 8th, and in that conversation, in your opening statement, you described how Ambassador Sondland used the term stalemate. What did you understand the concern about a stalemate to be?",15:11,Taylor/Kent
319,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Ambassador Sondland said that if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. He began that again by repeating, this is not a quid pro quo, but if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. And what I understood for in that meeting, the meaning of stalemate was the security assistance would not come.",15:43,Taylor/Kent
320,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"So even though he said the words, there were no quid pro quo, he then went on to say, “But the security assistance will not come unless these investigations are done.” Is that what you’re saying?",16:15,Taylor/Kent
321,Section_7,Bill Taylor,My understanding that’s what was meant by stalemate.,16:27,Taylor/Kent
322,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,You also described in your opening statement a discussion you had about President Trump being a businessman who wanted to have people pay up before signing the check and what did you understand that to mean?,16:29,Taylor/Kent
323,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"This was an explanation that Ambassador Sondland gave me about his understanding of President Trump’s thought process. Ambassador Sondland is a businessman. President Trump’s a businessman. He was explaining to me the relationship, the, the understanding that a businessman would have when he’s about to sign a check. And by that he clearly meant that President Trump was thinking about or had in front of him the possibility of providing security assistance to Ukraine.",16:50,Taylor/Kent
324,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"It was similar to writing a check to someone who you were about to send. He used that analogy very clearly to indicate that this would require something if that person owed him something before he signed the check, he wanted to get whatever he was owed, paid back to him. Ambassador Volker used very similar language about a week later, which indicates to me that they had that conversation as well.",17:32,Taylor/Kent
325,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did Ukraine owe anything to the United States?,18:05,Taylor/Kent
326,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Goldman, they didn’t. They owed appreciation for the support and they were getting support and they appreciated that, but there was nothing owed to president Trump on that.",18:09,Taylor/Kent
327,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,But you understood the upshot of this comment made by both Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker to be that President Trump believed that Ukraine owed him something personally. Is that accurate?,18:25,Taylor/Kent
328,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"It’s hard to understand, but there was a feeling by President Trump that he, and this came out in the transcript, I’m sorry, this came out in the discussion with the inaugural delegation when they came back to have a conversation with President Trump on May 23rd. That he had a feeling of having been wronged by the Ukrainians, and so this was something that he thought they owed him to fix that wrong.",18:39,Taylor/Kent
329,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Right. But what he was talking about as you understood it, because in the context of the conversation is that what he owed him were these investigations that he won, is that right?",19:19,Taylor/Kent
330,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That would have been to fix the wrong. Exactly.,19:28,Taylor/Kent
331,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And those investigations into the 2016 election and Biden and Burisma.,19:31,Taylor/Kent
332,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,19:35,Taylor/Kent
333,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, during this early period in September, we’ve talked a little bit about the fact that you continually heard that the President was repeatedly saying that there was no quid pro quo. Is that right?",19:37,Taylor/Kent
334,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,19:49,Taylor/Kent
335,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And he still says that repeatedly today, but regardless of what you call it, whether it’s a quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, abuse power of the office of the presidency, the fact of the matter, as you understood it, is that security assistance and the White House meeting, were not going to be provided unless Ukraine initiated these two investigations that would benefit Donald Trump’s reelection. Is that what you understood the facts to be?",19:50,Taylor/Kent
336,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Goldman, what I can do here for you today is tell you what I heard from people. And in this case it was what I heard from Ambassador Sondland. He described the conditions for the security assistance and the White House meeting in those terms that were dependent upon, conditioned on, pursuing these investigations.",20:20,Taylor/Kent
337,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And you heard that from Ambassador Sondland himself, correct?",20:47,Taylor/Kent
338,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Correct.,20:50,Taylor/Kent
339,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And you also heard a similar story from Mr. Morrison as well. Is that right?,20:51,Taylor/Kent
340,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Who also talked to Ambassador Sondland about the conversations that he had had in Warsaw with Ukrainians.,20:55,Taylor/Kent
341,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And what Mr. Morrison recounted to you was substantially similar to what Mr. Sondland recounted to you, right?",21:02,Taylor/Kent
342,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Yes.,21:08,Taylor/Kent
343,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And so regardless of what Ukrainians may say now, now that everything is out in the public and we’re here in this public hearing that they felt no pressure from President Trump. It was your clear understanding, was it not? That in early September when the pressure campaign was still secret that the Ukrainians believed that they needed to announce these public investigations? Is that right?",21:10,Taylor/Kent
344,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Goldman I know that the Ukrainians were very concerned about the security assistance. And I know that they were prepared or preparing to make a public statement that is with a CNN interview, that was being planned. Those are the two pieces that I know.",21:36,Taylor/Kent
345,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And that CNN interview was to announce these investigations as you understood it. Right?,22:02,Taylor/Kent
346,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That was the implication. That was certainly the implication.,22:07,Taylor/Kent
347,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"We’ve been focused a lot on the September timeframe, but I want to go back two months to July before the July 25th call, and you testified Ambassador Taylor in your opening statement that it was in the middle of July when you understood that the White House meeting was first a condition on these investigations. Is that accurate?",22:12,Taylor/Kent
348,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Yes. We were preparing, and I agreed that the White House meeting was going to be an important step in US Ukrainian relations. So in June and in early July, attempts to work out a way to get that meeting included a phone call. And so there were several conversations about how to have this phone call that eventually happened on July 25th.",22:35,Taylor/Kent
349,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And you described in your opening statement a July 10th white house meeting with a number of officials where Ambassador Bolton used the term that something was a drug deal. What did you understand him to mean in hearing that he said that, use this term drug deal?",23:02,Taylor/Kent
350,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Goldman, I don’t know. I don’t know what Ambassador Bolton had in mind.",23:19,Taylor/Kent
351,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And was that in reference to a discussion in that meeting related to the white house meeting that President Zelensky wanted and in connection to the investigations?,23:24,Taylor/Kent
352,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"The context of that comment was the discussion that Mr. Danylyuk, who was Mr. Bolton’s counterpart, Ukrainian counterpart, the national security advisor had had with Mr. Bolton. And that conversation was very substantive. Up until the point where the White House meeting was raised and Mr Ambassador Sondland intervened to talk about the investigations. It was at that point that Ambassador Bolton ceased the meeting, closed the meeting, finished the meeting, and told his staff to report this meeting to the lawyers. And he also later then indicated to Fiona Hill, who was also a participant on NSC staff, that he, Ambassador Bolton didn’t want to be associated with this drug deal. So it was in the implication was it was the domestic politics that was being cooked up.",23:36,Taylor/Kent
353,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And did Ambassador Sondland say this in front of the Ukrainian officials to your understanding?,24:50,Taylor/Kent
354,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Ambassador Sondland in the meeting where Ambassador Bolton was having a conversation with his counterpart, raised the issue of investigations being important to come before the white house meeting that had just been raised.",24:57,Taylor/Kent
355,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And Ukrainian officials were there?,25:16,Taylor/Kent
356,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"And Ukrainian officials were in that meeting, yes sir.",25:18,Taylor/Kent
357,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, around this same time in mid July, did you have any discussions with Ukrainian officials about these investigations?",25:20,Taylor/Kent
358,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I don’t recall.,25:33,Taylor/Kent
359,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Well, let me show you a text message that you wrote on July 21st where you wrote it again to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker. And if you could just read what you wrote here on July 21st.",25:35,Taylor/Kent
360,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Gordon, one thing Kurt and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Donylyuks point that President Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic reelection politics.",25:49,Taylor/Kent
361,Section_7,Bill Taylor,… early as an instrument in Washington domestic reelection politics.,26:03,Taylor/Kent
362,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And Sasha Danyliuk, I think you just said is Ambassador Bolton’s counterpart, right?",26:04,Taylor/Kent
363,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"He’s the national security advisor to the … He was. He’s no longer, but was at the time.",26:08,Taylor/Kent
364,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,What did you understand it to mean that Zelensky had concerns about being an instrument in Washington domestic reelection politics.,26:12,Taylor/Kent
365,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Danyliuk understood that these investigations were pursuant to Mr. Giuliani’s request to develop information to find information about Burisma and the Bidens. This was very well-known in public. Mr Giuliani had made this point clear in several instances in the beginning, in the springtime. And Mr. Danyliuk was aware that that was a problem.",26:22,Taylor/Kent
366,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And would you agree that because President Zelensky is worried about this, they understood at least that there was some pressure for them to pursue these investigations? Is that fair?",26:56,Taylor/Kent
367,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Danyliuk indicated that President Zelensky certainly understood it, that he did not want to get involved in these type of activities.",27:09,Taylor/Kent
368,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, I’m going to move ahead now to July 25th, which was when President Trump and President Zelensky had the phone call. But before we get to the phone call, I want to show both of you a text message. Neither of you is on this text message. It is between Ambassador Volker and Andriy Yermak, a top aid to President Zelensky. I will read it because neither of you is on it.",27:21,Taylor/Kent
369,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Ambassador Volker says, “Good lunch. Thanks. Heard from White House. Assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate/get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck. See you tomorrow. Kurt.” And this was less than a half hour before the call actually occurred.",27:43,Taylor/Kent
370,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now Ambassador Taylor, was Ambassador Volker with you in Ukraine at this time?",28:07,Taylor/Kent
371,Section_7,Bill Taylor,He was.,28:13,Taylor/Kent
372,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did you know that he was prepping President Zelensky for this phone call with President Trump in this way?,28:13,Taylor/Kent
373,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Not in this way, Mr. Colvin. But I knew that Ambassador Volker was prepping Ukrainians for the phone call earlier on. That is, at a meeting in Toronto on July 2nd Ambassador Volker had a conversation with President Zelensky and had indicated in a phone call that he at that time was going to talk Mr. Zelensky, President Zelensky through the the steps that need to be taken in order to get to the phone call.",28:19,Taylor/Kent
374,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Understood. And you testified earlier that the security assistance had already been frozen to your knowledge, at least by July 18th. Is that right?",28:57,Taylor/Kent
375,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,29:07,Taylor/Kent
376,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,So that was just a week earlier than this?,29:08,Taylor/Kent
377,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,29:10,Taylor/Kent
378,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"So just so we’re clear, Ambassador Taylor, before this July 25th call, President Trump had frozen the security assistance that Ukraine needed and that the White House meeting was conditioned on Ukraine initiating this investigation and that had been relayed to the Ukrainians. Is that an accurate state of play at this time?",29:10,Taylor/Kent
379,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"That’s an accurate state of play that I, at that point, had no indication that any discussion of the security assistance being subject to conditioned on investigations had taken place.",29:33,Taylor/Kent
380,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Right. But you understood that the White House meeting?,29:48,Taylor/Kent
381,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,29:50,Taylor/Kent
382,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"All right. Let’s move ahead to this July 25th call between the Presidents. Now, am I correct that neither of you were on this call? Is that right, Mr. Kent?",29:52,Taylor/Kent
383,Section_7,George Kent,That’s correct.,30:03,Taylor/Kent
384,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,30:03,Taylor/Kent
385,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And you were neither as well?,30:03,Taylor/Kent
386,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Right.,30:05,Taylor/Kent
387,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,So you both read it after it was released publicly at the end of September?,30:05,Taylor/Kent
388,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Yes.,30:10,Taylor/Kent
389,Section_7,George Kent,Yes.,30:10,Taylor/Kent
390,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"I want to spend just a little time reading the transcript as we’ve been encouraged to do. And I want to particularly note four excerpts of the transcript. One that relates to the security assistance we’ve been talking about, another that discusses a favor that President Trump asked of President Zelensky, a third where President Trump asks the Ukrainian President to investigate his political opponent, former Vice President Biden, and then a final one where the Ukrainian President directly links the desired White House visit to the political investigations that President Trump wanted.",30:12,Taylor/Kent
391,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"So let’s look at the first excerpt, which is near the beginning of the call when President Zelensky discusses the military aid that the US provides to Ukraine. He says, “I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. Specifically, we are almost ready to buy more javelins from the United States for defense purposes.”",30:50,Taylor/Kent
392,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, at the time of this phone call, Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, you both knew that the aide had been frozen. Is that right?",31:16,Taylor/Kent
393,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,31:24,Taylor/Kent
394,Section_7,George Kent,Yes.,31:25,Taylor/Kent
395,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And Ambassador Taylor, you testified that President Trump obviously also knew that the aid had been frozen as well since he was responsible for doing that. Is that correct?",31:26,Taylor/Kent
396,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"That’s what I had been told. That’s what we heard on that conference call, yes.",31:36,Taylor/Kent
397,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"But to neither of your knowledge, the Ukrainians were not aware of that at that point?",31:41,Taylor/Kent
398,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Not to my knowledge.,31:46,Taylor/Kent
399,Section_7,George Kent,Not to my knowledge.,31:47,Taylor/Kent
400,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"But right after President Zelensky thanks President Trump for his great support in the area of defense, president Trump then says … And we’ll go to the next excerpt, ” I want you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say CrowdStrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people. The server, they say Ukraine has it.”",31:48,Taylor/Kent
401,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And then at the end of the paragraph he says, “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.” Now, Mr. Kent, you’ve testified a little bit about how important this White House meeting was to Presidents Zelensky. How would you expect a new Ukrainian President to interpret a request for a favor from the President of the United States?",32:19,Taylor/Kent
402,Section_7,George Kent,"I cannot interpret the mind of President Zelensky, other than to say that it was very clear that what they were hoping to get out of this meeting was a date and a confirmation that he could come to Washington.",32:43,Taylor/Kent
403,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Obviously you can’t put yourself in the mind, but if the Ukrainian President for a country that’s so dependent on the United States for all things, including military assistance, is requested to do a favor, how do you think the Ukrainians would interpret that?",32:58,Taylor/Kent
404,Section_7,George Kent,"Well, if you go further into the call record as part of this, and we don’t have it on screen, but to the best of my recollection reading it after it was released in September 25th, President Zelensky went into having … ” Whatever your problems were, that was the old team. I’ve got a new team and we will do whatever’s appropriate and be transparent and honest about it.”",33:14,Taylor/Kent
405,Section_7,George Kent,"I don’t remember the exact words, but he was trying to be, in his own words and response, be responsive to conduct the business of Ukrainian government in a transparent and honest manner.",33:38,Taylor/Kent
406,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now when he talks about this CrowdStrike in a server, what do you understand this to be a reference to?",33:53,Taylor/Kent
407,Section_7,George Kent,"To be honest, I had not heard of CrowdStrike until I read this transcript on September 25th.",34:01,Taylor/Kent
408,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Do you now understand what it relates to?,34:06,Taylor/Kent
409,Section_7,George Kent,I understand it has to do with the story that there’s a server with missing emails. I also understand that one of the owners of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American. I am not aware of any Ukrainian connection to the company.,34:08,Taylor/Kent
410,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, are you aware that this is all part of a larger allegation that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election?",34:28,Taylor/Kent
411,Section_7,George Kent,Yes. That is my understanding.,34:37,Taylor/Kent
412,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And to your knowledge, is there any factual basis to support the allegation that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election?",34:38,Taylor/Kent
413,Section_7,George Kent,"To my knowledge, there is no factual basis. No.",34:47,Taylor/Kent
414,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And in fact, who did interfere in the 2016 election?",34:50,Taylor/Kent
415,Section_7,George Kent,I think it’s amply clear that Russian interference was at the heart of the interference in the 2016 election cycle.,34:53,Taylor/Kent
416,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Let’s move to the third excerpt that I mentioned related to Vice President Biden and it says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son.” This is President Trump speaking, “That Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it, it sounds horrible.”",35:00,Taylor/Kent
417,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now at the time of this call, Vice President Biden was the front runner for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 election. And Mr. Kent, are you familiar as you indicate in your opening statement about these allegations related to Vice President Biden?",35:25,Taylor/Kent
418,Section_7,George Kent,I am.,35:39,Taylor/Kent
419,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And to your knowledge, is there any factual basis to support those allegations?",35:40,Taylor/Kent
420,Section_7,George Kent,None whatsoever.,35:44,Taylor/Kent
421,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"When Vice President Biden acted in Ukraine, did he act in accordance with official US policy?",35:46,Taylor/Kent
422,Section_7,George Kent,He did.,35:53,Taylor/Kent
423,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now let’s go to then the last excerpts that I wanted to highlight, which is President Zelensky speaking. And he says, “I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and we will work on the investigation.”",35:55,Taylor/Kent
424,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now Ambassador Taylor, right after President Zelensky mentions is much desired Washington visit he says, “On the other hand.” And then says that Ukraine will be very serious about the investigation. Is this the same link between the White House visit and the investigations that Ambassador Volker had texted to Andriy Yermak just a few minutes before this conversation?",36:21,Taylor/Kent
425,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s my assumption.,36:45,Taylor/Kent
426,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, just to summarize what we’ve just read in this July 25th call between the Presidents, the Ukrainian President thanked President Trump for security assistance that President Trump had just frozen. To which President Trump responded that he wanted President Zelensky to do him a favor though by investigating the 2016 US election and the Bidens.",36:47,Taylor/Kent
427,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Then President Zelensky says that he will pursue these investigations right after he mentions the White House visit. Is that your understanding Ambassador Taylor, of what we just read?",37:08,Taylor/Kent
428,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Yes.,37:18,Taylor/Kent
429,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And Mr. Kent, is that yours?",37:18,Taylor/Kent
430,Section_7,George Kent,Yes.,37:20,Taylor/Kent
431,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,All right. I yield back.,37:21,Taylor/Kent
432,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Ambassador Taylor, Mr. Kent, President Trump’s concerns about Ukraine’s role in the 2016 election. You believe he genuinely believed they were working against him, right? Ambassador Taylor?",00:01,Taylor/Kent
433,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Castor, I don’t know what President or candidate Trump was thinking about the Ukrainians.",00:14,Taylor/Kent
434,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Didn’t he in this Oval Office meeting on May 23rd after the Zelensky inauguration, didn’t he lament that the Ukrainians were out to get them?",00:20,Taylor/Kent
435,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I heard that his response to the suggestion that Mr. Zelensky visit president Trump in the Oval Office was not well received and that he had concerns about Ukrainians, yes.",00:32,Taylor/Kent
436,Section_7,Steve Castor,"But from the president’s perspective if the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, one of the most influential diplomats, is penning an op ed certainly with the okay of President Poroshenko, the DNC consultants are conferring with Ukrainian officials at the embassy. Former Prime Minister Yatsenyuk is saying things on social media, Interior Minister Avakov, who has a spanned both the Poroshenko and the Zelensky realm, is also saying some very unkind things on social media about the president. You certainly can appreciate that President Trump was very concerned that some elements of the Ukrainian establishment were not in favor of him, did not support him, and were out to get him.",00:49,Taylor/Kent
437,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"I’ll allow the question, but-",01:45,Taylor/Kent
438,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Parliamentary inquiry, are you seriously interrupting our time here?",01:51,Taylor/Kent
439,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"I’ve will allow the question. I won’t dock this from the time. I just want to be clear Ambassador, if you’re able to verify the things that council has asked you in the prerequisite of the question, that’s fine. Otherwise, in questions from the majority or the minority, that may assume facts not in evidence before you, you should be cautioned about that.",01:53,Taylor/Kent
440,Section_7,John Ratcliffe,"Mr. chairman, point of order.",02:17,Taylor/Kent
441,Section_7,Adam Schiff,The time is with minority council. Mr. Ratcliffe.,02:21,Taylor/Kent
442,Section_7,John Ratcliffe,"Chairman, I sat here through the first 45 minutes and literally had an objection to almost the foundation of every question that Mr. Goldman asked regarding facts not in evidence, leading, but House Resolution 660 does not say that we are under the federal rules of evidence. If it is your position that I should be asserting objections to questions that violate the federal rules of evidence, let me know now, because this hearing’s going to change significantly.",02:27,Taylor/Kent
443,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"As I said, Mr. Ratcliffe, I will allow the question.",03:00,Taylor/Kent
444,Section_7,Devin Nunes,"I think the gentleman has a different question about the rules, so what are the rules that are going to govern this?",03:05,Taylor/Kent
445,Section_7,Adam Schiff,Does the ranking member seek recognition?,03:13,Taylor/Kent
446,Section_7,Devin Nunes,I’m yielding to you to the question I just asked you.,03:15,Taylor/Kent
447,Section_7,Adam Schiff,For what purpose to seek recognition?,03:19,Taylor/Kent
448,Section_7,Devin Nunes,To answer Mr. Ratcliffe’s question.,03:21,Taylor/Kent
449,Section_7,Adam Schiff,I have answered it. You may resume your question.,03:23,Taylor/Kent
450,Section_7,John Ratcliffe,"Respectfully, Mr. Chairman, you haven’t answered my question whether or not I should be asserting assumes facts not in evidence or leading objections to questions that are posed from this point forward. That’s my question.",03:25,Taylor/Kent
451,Section_7,Adam Schiff,"Mr Ratcliffe. I’ll say once again, I’m not objecting to the question, but I am instructing the witness that they should not presume questions, from the majority or the minority, that may represent facts not in evidence, are correct. I have answered your question. We will resume the questioning and resume the clock. Mr. Castor.",03:40,Taylor/Kent
452,Section_7,Steve Castor,So you certainly can appreciate president Trump’s concerns.,04:05,Taylor/Kent
453,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Caster. I don’t know the exact nature of President Trump’s concerns. In my deposition, I recall, you handed me the political article, which listed at least three of the elements that you have described earlier and you’ve recognized and I have confirmed with the ranking minority member that it’s first I’d heard of those and was surprised by those. I don’t know President Trump’s reaction to those.",04:11,Taylor/Kent
454,Section_7,Steve Castor,"In the information published by Serhiy Leshchenko, former Ukrainian investigative journalist, and then he was a member of the parliament about the Manafort black ledgers in August of 2016, the very day that was published, Mr. Manafort resigned from the campaign, correct?",04:44,Taylor/Kent
455,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I don’t know, Mr. Castor.",05:04,Taylor/Kent
456,Section_7,Steve Castor,Certainly that gives rise to some concern that there are elements of the Ukrainian establishment that were out to get the president. That’s a very reasonable belief of his. Correct?,05:08,Taylor/Kent
457,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I don’t know.,05:19,Taylor/Kent
458,Section_7,Steve Castor,"The run up to the 2016 election, there’s many facts that remain unresolved. Agreed?",05:24,Taylor/Kent
459,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I’m sorry. What’s the question?,05:32,Taylor/Kent
460,Section_7,Steve Castor,There are many facts relating to the run-up of the 2016 election that remain unresolved.,05:33,Taylor/Kent
461,Section_7,Bill Taylor,Any further?,05:40,Taylor/Kent
462,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Well, Attorney General Barr, in May of 2019 tasked the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, John Durham, to broadly examine the government’s collection of intelligence involving the president’s campaign. That effort, initially it was an administrative review, has turned into a criminal probe. And U.S. Attorney Durham is casting a wide net, and is following the facts where they may lead. Are you aware of that?",05:41,Taylor/Kent
463,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I’m aware that there is an investigation. That’s as much as I’m aware.,06:09,Taylor/Kent
464,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And so to the extent any information resides in Ukraine, it’s perfectly appropriate for the Ukrainians to try to get to the bottom of that, for the Ukrainians to cooperate with the United States through official channels to share that information. Correct?",06:12,Taylor/Kent
465,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Caster, can you say that one again? I’d appreciate it if you would restate the question.",06:24,Taylor/Kent
466,Section_7,Steve Castor,"To the extent Ukraine has facts related to the run-up of the 2016 election that are under the U.S. Attorney Durham’s probe, Ukraine should cooperate with the United States. And to the extent there are Ukrainians doing improper things, the Ukrainians ought to investigate that themselves. Correct?",06:30,Taylor/Kent
467,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Castor, The Ukrainian/American relations are very supportive. The Ukrainians will certainly be responsive to requests.",06:49,Taylor/Kent
468,Section_7,Steve Castor,"So when the president on the call transcript of July 25th, raises this with President Zelensky, and he urges that there be a connection between the Ukrainian government and the Justice Department, officially, I mean that’s the appropriate way to raise an issue with the Ukrainian president. Correct?",07:00,Taylor/Kent
469,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"It’s appropriate for the justice department and the prosecutor general to cooperate and to exchange information, yes.",07:18,Taylor/Kent
470,Section_7,Steve Castor,"But to the extent the president has concerns, and to the extent the attorney general is having U.S. Attorney Durham look into that, isn’t it entirely appropriate for the president to flag this for President Zelensky, and say that you should be in touch with our official channels?",07:27,Taylor/Kent
471,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Castor, I don’t know the precise appropriateness of these kinds of relations.",07:43,Taylor/Kent
472,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Now, were either of you involved with the preparation for the 7/25 call?",07:49,Taylor/Kent
473,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I was not.,07:55,Taylor/Kent
474,Section_7,George Kent,I was not.,07:56,Taylor/Kent
475,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And how do you account for that? I mean, you are two of the key officials with responsibility for Ukrainian policy. If the president of the United States is going to have a call with the leader of Ukraine, why wouldn’t you ordinarily be involved with the preparation?",07:57,Taylor/Kent
476,Section_7,George Kent,"Sir, we work for the Department of State in an Embassy overseas, and in preparation for a presidential phone call, that responsibility lies within the staff of the National Security Council. Normally, if there is enough sufficient time, national security staff can solicit information, usually from the state department, and we can draw on the embassy. But that’s only background information. And my understanding, having never worked at the National Security Council, is that national security staff write a memo to the president. And none of us see that outside of the national security staff.",08:16,Taylor/Kent
477,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. So the Chargé, or the U.S. Ambassador to the country wouldn’t ordinarily be on a call with a foreign leader?",08:47,Taylor/Kent
478,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct. Would not.,08:54,Taylor/Kent
479,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And did Colonel Vindman or anyone at the National Security Council staff reach out to you, Mr. Kent, in preparation for the call?",08:58,Taylor/Kent
480,Section_7,George Kent,"I was given notification the day before, on July 24th, and to the extent I had any role, it was to reach out to the embassy, give them a heads up, and ask them to ensure that the secure communications link, and the office of the president of Ukraine was functional, so the call could be patched through from the White House Situation Room.",09:06,Taylor/Kent
481,Section_7,Steve Castor,Did you provide any substantive advice to Colonel Vindman about the call and what ought to be the official position?,09:25,Taylor/Kent
482,Section_7,George Kent,I was not asked and I did not provide.,09:35,Taylor/Kent
483,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. Same with you, Ambassador?",09:37,Taylor/Kent
484,Section_7,Bill Taylor,The same.,09:40,Taylor/Kent
485,Section_7,Steve Castor,"You testified earlier that the call was on again, off again, and after the July 10th meeting with Ambassador Bolton, the consensus was the call was not going to happen. Is that correct?",09:44,Taylor/Kent
486,Section_7,George Kent,"I would not say that was a consensus. The State Department’s position was that a call between the two presidents would be useful, and once Zelensky’s party won the first ever absolute majority in parliamentary elections on July 21st, the idea of a congratulatory call made eminent sense from our perspective.",09:58,Taylor/Kent
487,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. And the call was scheduled. And did you get a readout, Ambassador Taylor, initially from the call?",10:15,Taylor/Kent
488,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I didn’t, Mr. Castor. We all read the statement that the Ukrainians put out. I got a read out several days later from Mr. Morrison, National Security Council.",10:25,Taylor/Kent
489,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. And how about you, Mr. Kent?",10:39,Taylor/Kent
490,Section_7,George Kent,"I, likewise, first saw the Ukrainian statement and I believe the next day, July 26th, which would have been a Friday, I did get a partial readout from Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, yes.",10:43,Taylor/Kent
491,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Ambassador Taylor, you said that the Ukrainian readout was cryptic. Is that just because it’s initially written in Ukrainian and translated to the U.S.?",10:56,Taylor/Kent
492,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"No, as a general rule, both United States and other countries, including Ukraine, will put out very short summaries that kind of hit the highlights of the discussion, but without going into detail.",11:05,Taylor/Kent
493,Section_7,Steve Castor,Okay. And you mentioned it was cryptic. Why did you think it was cryptic?,11:20,Taylor/Kent
494,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Having read the transcript and looking back at their summary, as I recall, and I don’t recall the exact words, but they said that there were issues to be pursued in order to improve relations between the two countries or something like that.",11:30,Taylor/Kent
495,Section_7,Steve Castor,That seems pretty ordinary.,11:50,Taylor/Kent
496,Section_7,Bill Taylor,It seems pretty ordinary.,11:51,Taylor/Kent
497,Section_7,Steve Castor,You were with president Zelensky the very next day?,11:52,Taylor/Kent
498,Section_7,Bill Taylor,We were. We had a meeting within the very next day.,11:55,Taylor/Kent
499,Section_7,Steve Castor,And did president Zelensky raise any concerns about his views of the call?,11:58,Taylor/Kent
500,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"So I, Mr. Volker, Mr. Sondland were in his office, and we asked him, I think, how the call. He said, “The call was fine, I was happy with the call.”",12:10,Taylor/Kent
501,Section_7,Steve Castor,Okay. And did you get any additional readouts subsequently about the call? When did you first learn that the call contained things that concerned you? Was that not until September 25th?,12:24,Taylor/Kent
502,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Morrison, as I say, briefed me several days later, before the end of July. I think is where I said in my testimony that he said it could have gone better. And he said that the call mentioned Mr. Giuliani. He also said that the call mentioned",12:41,Taylor/Kent
503,Section_7,Bill Taylor,… Mr. Giuliani. He also said that the call mentioned the former ambassador. Both of those were concerning.,13:02,Taylor/Kent
504,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Giuliani was heard [phrased 00:13:11] on the call by President Zelensky, correct?",13:09,Taylor/Kent
505,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I don’t recall. It could have been. Well, I have it hear of you like.",13:12,Taylor/Kent
506,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Yeah, it’s on page three. The first mention of Giuliani was from President Zelensky, it’s on page three. And President Zelensky says, “I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently, and we were hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine, and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.” Did that surprise you?",13:19,Taylor/Kent
507,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Again, I didn’t have the transcript at the time. All I heard was that Giuliani was mentioned; Mr. Morrison said that Giuliani was mentioned in the call.",13:43,Taylor/Kent
508,Section_7,Steve Castor,"But the way Zelensky states it here, it sounds like he is very much looking forward to speaking with America’s Mayor.",13:52,Taylor/Kent
509,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s what I found out when I read the transcript on the 25th of September or so.,14:01,Taylor/Kent
510,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. Now Mr. Kent, corruption in Ukraine’s endemic, correct?",14:06,Taylor/Kent
511,Section_7,George Kent,That’s correct.,14:14,Taylor/Kent
512,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And it affects the courts, the prosecutors, and there have historically been problems with all the prosecutors in Ukraine. Correct?",14:14,Taylor/Kent
513,Section_7,George Kent,"I would say up until the new set of prosecutors appointed by President Zelensky in the last two months, correct.",14:26,Taylor/Kent
514,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. And so the U.S. government, the consensus though at the State Department and the National Security Council, and the White House is that Zelensky’s the real deal. He’s a real reformer; he’s genuinely interested in rooting out corruption, prosecuting the bad guys, correct?",14:33,Taylor/Kent
515,Section_7,George Kent,"I would say we are cautiously optimistic and we will work wherever there is the political will to do the right thing, and put forward genuine reform.",14:49,Taylor/Kent
516,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And at the heart of the corruption is the oligarchical system, correct? Where the oligarchs take control often by virtual theft of … for example, the right to certain energy licenses. Correct?",15:00,Taylor/Kent
517,Section_7,George Kent,"That is one element, yes sir.",15:19,Taylor/Kent
518,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And the company, Barisma, it’s leader, Zlochevsky, he has a little bit of a storied history of corruption, doesn’t he?",15:20,Taylor/Kent
519,Section_7,George Kent,"Mr. Zlochevsky was Minister of Energy from 2010 to 2012 under the pro-Russian government, and he used his regulatory authority to award gas exploration licenses to companies that he, himself, controlled. That would be considered an act of corruption in my view, yes.",15:32,Taylor/Kent
520,Section_7,Steve Castor,Certainly self-dealing.,15:50,Taylor/Kent
521,Section_7,George Kent,Certainly self-dealing and self-enriching.,15:51,Taylor/Kent
522,Section_7,Steve Castor,And how did the Ukrainian government ultimately pursue that?,15:53,Taylor/Kent
523,Section_7,George Kent,"In the spring of 2014, the Ukrainian government, the new government after the Revolution of Dignity, turned to partners, particularly the U.S. and the U.K., to try to recover tens of billions of dollars of stolen assets. The first case that we tried to recover that money came from Mr. Zlochevsky. The Serious Crimes Office in the U.K. had already opened up an investigation. They worked with us and the Ukrainian authorities to develop more information. The $23 million was frozen until somebody in the General Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine shut the case, issued a letter to his lawyer, and that money went poof.",15:58,Taylor/Kent
524,Section_7,Steve Castor,He essentially paid a bribe to make the case go away.,16:32,Taylor/Kent
525,Section_7,George Kent,"That is our strong assumption, yes sir.",16:36,Taylor/Kent
526,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. Now at any point in time, has anyone in the Ukrainian government tried to reinvestigate that, or did those crimes just go unpunished and was he free to go?",16:38,Taylor/Kent
527,Section_7,George Kent,"Mr. Zlochevsky spent time as far as I understand in Moscow and Monaco after he fled Ukraine. We continued to raise as a point of order that because U.S. taxpayer dollars had been used to try to recover frozen assets that we have a fiduciary responsibility, and we continued to press Ukrainian officials to answer for why alleged corrupt prosecutors had closed a case, and have until now not gotten an satisfactory answer.",16:50,Taylor/Kent
528,Section_7,George Kent,"So to summarize, we thought that Mykola Zlochevsky had stolen money; we thought a prosecutor had taken a bribe to shut the case, and those were our main concerns.",17:19,Taylor/Kent
529,Section_7,Steve Castor,And are you in favor of that matter being fully investigated and prosecuted?,17:28,Taylor/Kent
530,Section_7,George Kent,"I think since U.S. taxpayer dollars were wasted, I would love to see the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office find who the corrupt prosecutor was that took the bribe and who much he was paid. And that’s what I said to the Deputy Prosecutor General on February 3rd, 2015.",17:35,Taylor/Kent
531,Section_7,Steve Castor,"But in addition to prosecuting the person that took the bribe, shouldn’t the organization or individual that sponsored the bribes be prosecuted?",17:50,Taylor/Kent
532,Section_7,George Kent,I would agree that the Ukrainian law authorities should uphold the rule of law and hold people to account for breaking Ukrainian law.,18:00,Taylor/Kent
533,Section_7,Steve Castor,"So this company, Barisma, involved in lots of criminal activity, correct? Over the years?",18:08,Taylor/Kent
534,Section_7,George Kent,I do not know that.,18:14,Taylor/Kent
535,Section_7,Steve Castor,"But over the years, it’s been involved in a number of questionable dealings, correct?",18:16,Taylor/Kent
536,Section_7,George Kent,"I would say that it’s the largest private gas producer in the country, and its business reputation is mixed.",18:21,Taylor/Kent
537,Section_7,Steve Castor,"So to the extent a new regime was coming in under President Zelensky, it certainly would be fair for the new prosecutor, a genuine prosecutor, to reexamine old crimes that hadn’t sufficiently been brought to justice, right?",18:29,Taylor/Kent
538,Section_7,George Kent,"I believe that the new Prosecutor General, [name 00:18:46], made a statement to that end, that they would be reviewing past cases. But keep in mind, this is a country where those that commit crimes generally never get held to account, so there’s a lot to review.",18:44,Taylor/Kent
539,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. Now this, the bribe was paid in what year?",18:58,Taylor/Kent
540,Section_7,George Kent,"To the best of my knowledge, the case against Zlochevsky, the former Minister, was shut down December of 2014.",19:04,Taylor/Kent
541,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. And right around that time, Barisma starts adding officials to its board, is that correct?",19:09,Taylor/Kent
542,Section_7,George Kent,"My understanding is yes, that Mykola Zlochevsky invited a series of new individuals to join the board in 2014.",19:17,Taylor/Kent
543,Section_7,Steve Castor,And do you know what his strategy was in adding officials to his board?,19:24,Taylor/Kent
544,Section_7,George Kent,I have never met Mr. Zlochevsky.,19:28,Taylor/Kent
545,Section_7,Steve Castor,Okay. And who are some of the folks he added to the board?,19:30,Taylor/Kent
546,Section_7,George Kent,"The most prominent person he added to the board was the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwa?niewski.",19:34,Taylor/Kent
547,Section_7,Steve Castor,And anyone else?,19:39,Taylor/Kent
548,Section_7,George Kent,"There were a number of others, including some Americans, and the most prominent one in this context is Hunter Biden.",19:40,Taylor/Kent
549,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. So Hunter Biden’s added to the board of Barisma. Now, do you think that creates a problem that Barisma may be adding people to its board for protection purposes?",19:46,Taylor/Kent
550,Section_7,George Kent,"Sir, I work for the government. I don’t work in the corporate sector, and so I believe that companies build their boards with a variety of reasons, not only to promote their business plans.",19:57,Taylor/Kent
551,Section_7,Steve Castor,Was Hunter Biden a corporation governance expert?,20:09,Taylor/Kent
552,Section_7,George Kent,I have no idea what Hunter Biden studied at university or what his CV says.,20:12,Taylor/Kent
553,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Like, is he the Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Ukraine?",20:16,Taylor/Kent
554,Section_7,George Kent,I have no awareness or knowledge of what his background was and what he may have done on the board of Barisma.,20:20,Taylor/Kent
555,Section_7,Steve Castor,So you don’t know whether he as any business experience in Ukraine prior to joining Barisma’s board?,20:28,Taylor/Kent
556,Section_7,George Kent,"I’ve heard nothing about prior experience, no.",20:34,Taylor/Kent
557,Section_7,Steve Castor,Okay. Do you know if he speaks Ukrainian?,20:37,Taylor/Kent
558,Section_7,George Kent,I do not.,20:38,Taylor/Kent
559,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Do you know if he possesses any other element other than the fact that he is the son of, at the time, the sitting Vice-President?",20:38,Taylor/Kent
560,Section_7,George Kent,I do not.,20:46,Taylor/Kent
561,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. Ambassador Taylor, do you know whether Hunter Biden offers anything other than the fact that his dad’s the former Vice-President?",20:47,Taylor/Kent
562,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I don’t.,20:54,Taylor/Kent
563,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Or at the time, was the Vice-President?",20:55,Taylor/Kent
564,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I have no knowledge of Hunter Biden.,20:57,Taylor/Kent
565,Section_7,Steve Castor,"But you would agree it raises questions, right? He was getting paid, I think, $50,000 a month to sit on the board? Do you know if he relocated to Ukraine?",20:59,Taylor/Kent
566,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I’m sorry, Mr. Castor. Say again.",21:12,Taylor/Kent
567,Section_7,Steve Castor,Do you know if Hunter Biden relocated to Ukraine?,21:14,Taylor/Kent
568,Section_7,Bill Taylor,No knowledge.,21:16,Taylor/Kent
569,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Do you know, Mr. Kent?",21:17,Taylor/Kent
570,Section_7,George Kent,"Again, no knowledge.",21:19,Taylor/Kent
571,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. So he’s getting paid $50,000 a month, but we don’t know whether he had any experience, he had any, spoke the language, or whether he moved to Ukraine, correct?",21:20,Taylor/Kent
572,Section_7,George Kent,Correct.,21:33,Taylor/Kent
573,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Now at this time, Vice-President was taking a specific interest in Ukraine, wasn’t he?",21:34,Taylor/Kent
574,Section_7,George Kent,He was.,21:39,Taylor/Kent
575,Section_7,Steve Castor,And could you tell us about that?,21:40,Taylor/Kent
576,Section_7,George Kent,"I believe while he was Vice-President, he made a total of six visits to Ukraine. One may have been during the old regime, Yanokovich, and that would make five visits after the Revolution of Dignity, which started February of 2014.",21:41,Taylor/Kent
577,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. And you were the DCM, the Deputy Chief of Mission, at the time, correct?",21:54,Taylor/Kent
578,Section_7,George Kent,"Starting in 2015, yes.",21:59,Taylor/Kent
579,Section_7,Steve Castor,Okay. And did Vice-President Biden come when you were at post?,22:00,Taylor/Kent
580,Section_7,George Kent,"He did not. I came back for Ukrainian language training, and so I missed several visits.",22:04,Taylor/Kent
581,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. Now you’ve seen Vice-President Biden’s, he’s sort of given a speech, and he’s a little folksy about how he went into Ukraine and he told the Ukrainians that if they don’t fire the prosecutor, they’re going to lose their $1 billion in loan guarantees. You’ve seen that, correct?",22:09,Taylor/Kent
582,Section_7,George Kent,"I have. I think it was a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in January, 2018.",22:30,Taylor/Kent
583,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Right. And he also said that he’s been there, Ukraine, 13 times. Do you know if that’s accurate?",22:34,Taylor/Kent
584,Section_7,George Kent,"To the best of my knowledge, when he was Vice-President he made six visits.",22:40,Taylor/Kent
585,Section_7,Steve Castor,And did the State Department ever express any concerns to the Vice-President’s office that the Vice-President’s role at the time in engaging on Ukraine presented any issues?,22:44,Taylor/Kent
586,Section_7,George Kent,No. The Vice-President’s role was critically important. It was top cover to help us pursue our policy agenda.,22:55,Taylor/Kent
587,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. But given Hunter Biden’s role on Barisma’s board of directors, at some point you testified in your deposition that you expressed some concern to the Vice-President’s office. Is that correct?",23:02,Taylor/Kent
588,Section_7,George Kent,That is correct.,23:12,Taylor/Kent
589,Section_7,Steve Castor,And what did they do about that concern that you expressed?,23:13,Taylor/Kent
590,Section_7,George Kent,I have no idea. I reported my concern to the office of the Vice-President.,23:16,Taylor/Kent
591,Section_7,Steve Castor,Okay. And that was the end of it? Nobody …,23:20,Taylor/Kent
592,Section_7,George Kent,"Sir, you would have to ask people who worked in the office of the Vice-President during 2015.",23:23,Taylor/Kent
593,Section_7,Steve Castor,"But after you expressed the concern of a perceived conflict of interest in the least, the Vice-President’s engagement in Ukraine didn’t decrease, did it?",23:28,Taylor/Kent
594,Section_7,George Kent,"Correct, because the Vice-President was promoting U.S. policy objectives in Ukraine.",23:39,Taylor/Kent
595,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Barisma didn’t cease, did it?",23:43,Taylor/Kent
596,Section_7,George Kent,"To the best of my knowledge, it didn’t. And my concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest.",23:49,Taylor/Kent
597,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Now Ambassador Taylor, I want to turn to the discussion of the irregular channel you described. And in fairness, this irregular channel of diplomacy, it’s not as outlandish as it could be. Is that correct?",23:56,Taylor/Kent
598,Section_7,George Kent,It’s not at outlandish as it could be. I agree with that.,24:20,Taylor/Kent
599,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. We have Ambassador Volker, who’s a former Senate-confirmed Ambassador to NATO; long-time State Department diplomat; and you’ve known Ambassador Volker for years, correct?",24:23,Taylor/Kent
600,Section_7,George Kent,That’s correct.,24:32,Taylor/Kent
601,Section_7,Steve Castor,"A man of unquestioned integrity, correct?",24:33,Taylor/Kent
602,Section_7,George Kent,That’s correct.,24:36,Taylor/Kent
603,Section_7,Steve Castor,And somebody with incredible knowledge of the region.,24:37,Taylor/Kent
604,Section_7,George Kent,"With very good knowledge of the region, yes sir.",24:40,Taylor/Kent
605,Section_7,Steve Castor,And the best interests of the United States?,24:43,Taylor/Kent
606,Section_7,George Kent,I’m sure that’s right.,24:45,Taylor/Kent
607,Section_7,Steve Castor,And the best interest of Ukraine.,24:45,Taylor/Kent
608,Section_7,George Kent,"His first priority is clearly the United States, and to the extent that Ukraine has an implication for that, yes; Ukraine as well.",24:48,Taylor/Kent
609,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. And the second member of the irregular channel is Ambassador Sondland, who is Senate-confirmed Ambassador to the E.U., so his involvement here, while not necessarily part of his official duties as the Ambassador to the E.U., it certainly is not outlandish for him to be interested and engaged pursuant to the President or Secretary Pompeo’s direction, correct?",25:00,Taylor/Kent
610,Section_7,George Kent,It’s a little unusual for the U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. to play a role in Ukraine policy.,25:25,Taylor/Kent
611,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. And you know, it might be irregular, but it’s certainly not outlandish. And then Secretary Perry is the third member of the irregular channel. He’s certainly a Senate-confirmed official; somebody with deep experience in energy markets, and he was pursuing some liquified national, natural gas projects in Ukraine",25:32,Taylor/Kent
612,Section_7,George Kent,"That’s correct, Mr. Castor.",26:01,Taylor/Kent
613,Section_7,Steve Castor,"So his involvement, Secretary",26:02,Taylor/Kent
614,Section_7,Steve Castor,-in Ukraine.,26:03,Taylor/Kent
615,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"That’s correct, Mr. Castor.",26:03,Taylor/Kent
616,Section_7,Steve Castor,"So his involvement, Secretary Perry’s involvement is perfectly acceptable?",26:03,Taylor/Kent
617,Section_7,Bill Taylor,It is.,26:06,Taylor/Kent
618,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. Now this irregular channel, as it developed, when did you determine that it became problematic? I mean, in your opening statement identified yourself appropriately as the leader of the regular channel.",26:06,Taylor/Kent
619,Section_7,Bill Taylor,At least a participant. There’s another leader of the regular channel.,26:27,Taylor/Kent
620,Section_7,Steve Castor,When did you first develop concerns that the irregular channel was being problematic?,26:33,Taylor/Kent
621,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"So I arrived in Kyiv in mid September. By late September, a couple of phone calls with-",26:41,Taylor/Kent
622,Section_7,Steve Castor,"You arrived in Kyiv in June, right?",26:50,Taylor/Kent
623,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"June, sorry.",26:51,Taylor/Kent
624,Section_7,Steve Castor,June 17th.,26:53,Taylor/Kent
625,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mid-June. June 17th thank you. And so by the end of June, I had begun to hear references to investigations as something that would have to happen prior to the meeting that president Trump had offered to presidents Zelensky. And That began to raise questions for me.",26:55,Taylor/Kent
626,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. Now, you’ve known Ambassador Volker, and you’ve certainly have a reason to know Ambassador Sondland. What did you do at this point, or did you ever try to wrest control of the irregular channel?",27:19,Taylor/Kent
627,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I didn’t try to wrest control of the irregular channel, do that. At the time when I-",27:35,Taylor/Kent
628,Section_7,Steve Castor,Well why not though? If you had these concerns.,27:43,Taylor/Kent
629,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Because Ms. Castor, at the time as Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent testified both channels, both of those, both channels were interested in having a meeting between President Zelensky and President Trump. So there’s no reason to kind of wrest control if we’re going in the same direction.",27:45,Taylor/Kent
630,Section_7,Steve Castor,"But at some point you developed concerns. I mean, your opening statement is here. I mean, you’re the impeachment witness number one, and you’re number two, Mr. Kent. For the case impeaching the president of the United States because of the concerns you’ve testified about the irregular channel. Correct.",28:10,Taylor/Kent
631,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I was concerned when the irregular channel appeared to be going against the overall… The irregular channel was going against the overall direction of and purpose of the regular channels.,28:31,Taylor/Kent
632,Section_7,Steve Castor,"As I understand the record, however, when you arrived in Ukraine, you had the support of the secretary and the secretary’s top advisor counselor, Ulrich Brechbuhl, correct?",28:44,Taylor/Kent
633,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That is correct.,28:55,Taylor/Kent
634,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And they assured you that if you had any, you would be able to contact them and they would have your back.",28:56,Taylor/Kent
635,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That is correct.,29:03,Taylor/Kent
636,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And you knew going in that the Rudy Giuliani element presented some complexities, correct?",29:04,Taylor/Kent
637,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I was concerned about Rudy Giuliani’s statements and involvement in the Ukraine policy. Yes.,29:11,Taylor/Kent
638,Section_7,Steve Castor,"So when it genuinely became a concern for you, what did you do to either engage Sondland and Volker and Perry and Giuliani… By the way, have you ever met Rudy Giuliani during these times relevant?",29:22,Taylor/Kent
639,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Not during the times relevant. Mr. Giuliani visited Ukraine one time when I was there, I think in 2007 or ’08. That’s the only time I’ve met him.",29:39,Taylor/Kent
640,Section_7,Steve Castor,Okay. So you’ve never had any communications with Rudy Giuliani as part of these irregular channel business?,29:48,Taylor/Kent
641,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct. That’s correct.,29:58,Taylor/Kent
642,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And anyway, getting back to my question, did you try to engage a Brechbuhl or the secretary during this time period? I know you said that you had I believe a August 21st or 22nd telephone call with Brechbuhl. You had a July 10th telephone call with Brechbuhl and then you sent a first-person cable to the secretary on August 29th.",30:02,Taylor/Kent
643,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,30:25,Taylor/Kent
644,Section_7,Steve Castor,Is that sort of the universe of initiatives you took inside the State Department to raise your concerns about the irregular channel?,30:27,Taylor/Kent
645,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I also raised my concerns with Deputy Secretary George Kent, in particular early on when, I think I may have mentioned this phone call that was odd in that it did not include the normal staff, indeed Ambassador Sondland’s staff. And that struck me as unusual. I consulted with Mr. Kent, and at his suggestion made a note of this and also had, I think at that point I had a conversation with Mr. Brechbuhl.",30:36,Taylor/Kent
646,Section_7,Steve Castor,"That was a June 28th call, I believe.",31:13,Taylor/Kent
647,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,31:14,Taylor/Kent
648,Section_7,Steve Castor,"And in your opening statement you expressed some concerns about what Ambassador Sondland had said, but then once Zelensky got on the phone it proceeded in a very regular channel way, correct?",31:17,Taylor/Kent
649,Section_7,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,31:29,Taylor/Kent
650,Section_7,Steve Castor,"The June 28th call, at least in and of itself, didn’t ultimately as it played out, present any problems for you?",31:31,Taylor/Kent
651,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"The call with President Zelensky did not. The preparation for that call and the preparation included maybe 15 minutes of just the Americans that would stay on the call. And that, again, that was a little irregular in that it didn’t have the staff. It was also in that pre-call, in that 15 minutes before President Zelensky got on the phone where Ambassador Volker told the rest of the participants that he was planning to have a conversation with President Zelensky in Toronto in three days, four days, where he would outline for President Zelensky the important components of the phone call that we were trying to establish.",31:38,Taylor/Kent
652,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay, and you didn’t have any issue with that, did you?",32:30,Taylor/Kent
653,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"The only issue I had with that Mr. Castor was there was reference to investigations in, I believe, I’ll have to check my notes on that, but that there was… raised issues for me that I didn’t understand what Ambassador Volker had in mind that he was specifically going to raise with Mr. Zelensky. That was a little bit of a concern.",32:34,Taylor/Kent
654,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. I mean the president’s expressed his interest in certain investigations, certainly relating to the 2016 election and relating to this corrupt Burisma outfit. So that wasn’t inconsistent with the president’s message, right?",33:01,Taylor/Kent
655,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I’m not sure Ms. Castor, can ask you to repeat the question.",33:23,Taylor/Kent
656,Section_7,Steve Castor,"The president’s concerns about the 2016 election and needing to get to the bottom of it and the president’s concerns as it ultimately related to the Burisma company. I mean, if Ambassador Volker is raising that with Zelensky that’s consistent with the direction of the president, correct?",33:27,Taylor/Kent
657,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"The president’s interest, or I would say Mr. Giuliani’s interest, because that’s what was very clear at the time. Mr. Giuliani’s interest in pursuing these investigations was of concern, but…",33:54,Taylor/Kent
658,Section_7,Steve Castor,"By the way, do you know how many times Volker met with Giuliani?",34:13,Taylor/Kent
659,Section_7,Bill Taylor,I don’t.,34:16,Taylor/Kent
660,Section_7,Steve Castor,How many would you guess? Was he talking to him all the time or meeting with them all the time?,34:16,Taylor/Kent
661,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"Mr Castor, I don’t know.",34:21,Taylor/Kent
662,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Okay. At his deposition, he told us just once, and he texted back and forth with the mayor, had a call or two, but it wasn’t a pervasive engagement for ambassador Volker. Were you aware of that?",34:22,Taylor/Kent
663,Section_7,Bill Taylor,"I was not aware. I was aware of one breakfast, I think, but that’s the only one that I was aware of.",34:40,Taylor/Kent
664,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Mr. Kent, before my time expires, I want to circle back to the company of Burisma. You testified at your deposition that there was an instance you USAID had engaged with Burisma, possibly sponsoring a program, and you took issue with that and recommended USAID to pull back from that. Could you tell us about that?",34:45,Taylor/Kent
665,Section_7,George Kent,"So I became aware in the summer, I believe, of 2016 that as a part of what I recall was a clean energy awareness campaign, the part of the USAID mission that worked on economics and governance, including energy, had sponsored some sort of contest for young Ukrainians to come up with a theme and there was a prize. I believe it may have been a camera. And they had co-sponsored with public private partnership being a buzzword, having a co-sponsorship with Burisma.",35:10,Taylor/Kent
666,Section_7,George Kent,"Given the past history of our interest in recovering stolen assets from Zlochevsky, it was my view that it was inappropriate for the embassy to be co-sponsoring a contest with Burisma. I raised that with the mission director at the embassy. She agreed, and the USAID mission kept the contest, but dropped the public private partnership sponsorship.",35:43,Taylor/Kent
667,Section_7,Adam Schiff,The time of the gentleman has expired.,36:14,Taylor/Kent
668,Section_7,Brad Wenstrup,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Taylor, this should be easy because I’m going to use a lot of your words from the previous deposition as we go forward. In your deposition, you spoke of support for Ukraine and its relationship to the United States and how much you support that. In 2014 you, and I’m quoting this, “Urged Obama administration to provide lethal defensive weapons in order to deter further Russian aggression.” Did the Obama administration provide lethal weapons?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
669,Section_8,Bill Taylor,No sir.,00:27,Taylor/Kent
670,Section_8,Brad Wenstrup,"They provided MREs and blankets and things like that. In your deposition, you also said President Obama’s objection was because it might provoke the Russians and in fact you testified in your deposition that the Obama administration didn’t have a good argument since Russia had already provoked and they have invaded Ukraine. Is that correct?",00:28,Taylor/Kent
671,Section_8,Bill Taylor,That’s correct sir.,00:49,Taylor/Kent
672,Section_8,Brad Wenstrup,"It’s a shame he didn’t take the advice of a combat veteran like you sir. Someone who understands what deterrence provides because a lot of Ukrainian lives could’ve been saved if he had taken your advice. In your deposition, you said, and I quote happy, you were “Happy with Trump administration’s assistance.” And it provided both lethal and financial aid. Did it not?",00:52,Taylor/Kent
673,Section_8,Bill Taylor,It did sir.,01:14,Taylor/Kent
674,Section_8,Brad Wenstrup,And you also stated that it was a substantial improvement. Is that correct?,01:16,Taylor/Kent
675,Section_8,Bill Taylor,"That’s correct, sir.",01:21,Taylor/Kent
676,Section_8,Brad Wenstrup,"So now we’re providing Javelins which kill Russian tanks. MREs and blankets do not do that. Today you said, “I was beginning to fear that the longstanding U.S. policy of strong support for Ukraine was shifting.” I have a little trouble with longstanding based on what we just talked about, because it wasn’t really longstanding strong support. It seems to me the strong support came with this administration. Would you agree with that, sir? Unless you consider MREs and blankets strong support. I wouldn’t call it longstanding.",01:22,Taylor/Kent
677,Section_8,Bill Taylor,"The longstanding that I’m referring to there, Dr. Wenstrup, is the longstanding political support, economic support, and increasing military support.",01:57,Taylor/Kent
678,Section_8,Brad Wenstrup,Well certainly that strong support came from Congress.,02:07,Taylor/Kent
679,Section_8,Bill Taylor,It did.,02:10,Taylor/Kent
680,Section_8,Brad Wenstrup,"But it didn’t come from the previous administration as compared to what this administration has decided to do. The strong support came with this administration, not the Obama administration. And maybe now we understand what President Obama meant when he told Russian president Medvedev that he’d have more flexibility after his election. Maybe that flexibility was to deny lethal aid to the Ukraine, allowing Russia to March right in and kill Ukrainians. Again in your deposition, you urged the Obama administration officials to provide lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine in order to deter further Russian aggression. And now they have that under this administration, don’t they, Mr. Ambassador?",02:10,Taylor/Kent
681,Section_8,Bill Taylor,"They have the Javelins. Yes, sir.",02:53,Taylor/Kent
682,Section_8,Brad Wenstrup,Thank you-,02:55,Taylor/Kent
683,Section_8,Jackie Speier,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you both for your true heroic efforts, both tonight, today, and also throughout your careers. I’d like to start with you, Mr. Kent. In your testimony, you said that you had, “In mid-August, it became clear to me that Giuliani’s efforts to gin up politically motivated investigations were now infecting US engagement with Ukraine, leveraging President’s Zelensky’s desire for a White House meeting.” Mr. Kent, did you actually write a memo documenting your concerns that there was an effort underway to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation to benefit President Trump?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
684,Section_9,George Kent,"Yes, ma’am. I wrote a memo to the file on August 16th.",00:46,Taylor/Kent
685,Section_9,Jackie Speier,"But we don’t have access to that memo, do we?",00:49,Taylor/Kent
686,Section_9,George Kent,"I submitted it to the State Department, subject to the September 27th subpoena.",00:52,Taylor/Kent
687,Section_9,Jackie Speier,"And we have not received one piece of paper from the State Department relative to this investigation. Both of you have made compelling cases of the importance of Ukraine to Europe, to the 70 years of peace, the benefit that it has to the United States national security, and our goal to continue to support sovereignty of nations. Meanwhile, Russia is violently attacking people in Ukraine in the Donbass area. So withholding military aid, does that weaken Ukraine?",00:56,Taylor/Kent
688,Section_9,George Kent,"Well, I think it sends the wrong signal and it did for a short period of time. Again, the assistance from the FYI 19 was released and is in the process of heading towards Ukraine.",01:39,Taylor/Kent
689,Section_9,Jackie Speier,Does it embolden Russia when there was no aid being sent to Ukraine?,01:52,Taylor/Kent
690,Section_9,George Kent,"I think the signal that there is controversy and question about the US support of Ukraine sends the signal to Vladimir Putin that he can leverage that as he seeks to negotiate with not only Ukraine, but other countries.",01:59,Taylor/Kent
691,Section_9,Jackie Speier,"Thank you. Ambassador Taylor, I think you mentioned that a White House meeting for Zelensky would boost his ability to negotiate for a peaceful settlement with Vladimir Putin and Russia in general. Is that true?",02:12,Taylor/Kent
692,Section_9,Bill Taylor,"Ms. Speier, it is certainly true that US support for Mr. Zelensky, President Zelensky, and his negotiations with the Russians is very important. And will enable him to get a better agreement with that support from the United States, both from the military assistance, but also just from the political assistance that we can provide.",02:28,Taylor/Kent
693,Section_9,Jackie Speier,But he has not yet had that White House meeting has he?,02:50,Taylor/Kent
694,Section_9,Bill Taylor,He has not.,02:53,Taylor/Kent
695,Section_9,Jackie Speier,"I think it’s ironic that Soviet born Lev Parnas, who has now been indicted, had a meeting with the President in the White House after participating in a number of campaign events for the President, and contributing $325,000 to the President’s PAC. So maybe it’s actually the requirement that you give money to the President’s PAC in order to get that meeting at the White House.",02:55,Taylor/Kent
696,Section_9,Jackie Speier,"Ambassador Taylor, is it true that the prosecutor general now has opened an investigation in Ukraine?",03:24,Taylor/Kent
697,Section_9,Bill Taylor,"Ms. Speier, the new prosecutor general that President Zelensky has appointed, is indeed investigating crimes in general. Is that your question?",03:36,Taylor/Kent
698,Section_9,Jackie Speier,Yes. But is he-,03:48,Taylor/Kent
699,Section_9,Bill Taylor,"Yes, he is in office and is investigating criminal activity.",03:50,Taylor/Kent
700,Section_9,Jackie Speier,Has he specified what investigations he’s undertaken?,03:56,Taylor/Kent
701,Section_9,Bill Taylor,No.,04:00,Taylor/Kent
702,Section_9,Jackie Speier,He has not. All right. I yield the rest of my time to Chairman Schiff.,04:01,Taylor/Kent
703,Section_9,Jim Himes,"Gentlemen, thank you for your testimony today. One of the things I find startling about these proceedings is that faced with very serious allegations of presidential misconduct, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don’t engage or defend that conduct. Rather they spin theories about black ledgers, and Steele dossiers and the startling revelation that Ukrainians might have been upset when a presidential candidate suggested that perhaps he would let the Russians keep Crimea. Or of course we get the attacks so epitomized by Mr. Nunez’s opening statement when he attacked Democrats, he attacked the media and most disgustingly attack the extraordinary men and women of the State Department and the FBI. When a defense does emerge it looks a little like this, Ukraine is a corrupt country and the President was just acting in a long line, a long tradition of actually trying to address corruption in Ukraine. Mr. Kent, you’ve worked on anti-corruption and rule of law efforts for much of your 27 year career, is that correct?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
704,Section_10,George Kent,"I have specialized in anti-corruption and rule of law issues since 2012, correct.",01:05,Taylor/Kent
705,Section_10,Jim Himes,"So like most of us up here, I don’t have a good sense of what a real anti-corruption effort that we must engage in all over the world all the time, what that looks like. So let me ask you to just take a minute and just characterize for us what a real initiative, what a real program of anti-corruption might look like.",01:10,Taylor/Kent
706,Section_10,George Kent,"If we’re doing a systemic holistic program, you need institutions with integrity. That starts with investigators, it goes to prosecutors, it goes to courts and eventually it goes to the corrections system. In countries like Ukraine, we generally start with law enforcement and that’s what we did in 2014, 15 with the new patrol police. There also as oftentimes needed a specialized anti-corruption agency in Ukraine that was called the National Anti-corruption Bureau or NABU.",01:31,Taylor/Kent
707,Section_10,George Kent,"There was a different body that reviewed asset declarations for unusual wealth called National Anti-corruption Prevention Council. And eventually we got to helping them establish a special anti-corruption prosecutor and eventually a high court on anti-corruption. And that was to try to create investigators, prosecutors and courts with integrity that couldn’t be bought and would be focused on high level corruption.",01:59,Taylor/Kent
708,Section_10,Jim Himes,"So what I’m hearing there, Mr. Kent, is a very comprehensive effort. So let me read you President Trump’s own words to the Ukrainian President in their July 25th phone call. And I quote, “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.” Mr. Kent, when you hear those words, do you hear the President participating in or requesting a thoughtful and well calibrated anti-corruption program?",02:26,Taylor/Kent
709,Section_10,George Kent,I do not.,02:59,Taylor/Kent
710,Section_10,Jim Himes,"And Mr. Kent and Mr. Taylor, the defenders of the President’s behavior have made a big deal out of the fact that Vice President Biden encouraged the Ukrainians to remove a corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor, 2016 Mr. Shokin. And in fact, Senator Rand Paul on Sunday said, and I quote him, “They’re impeaching the President Trump for exactly the same thing that Joe Biden did.” Is that correct? Is what the President did in his phone call and what Joe Biden did in terms of Mr. Shokin, are those exactly the same things? And if not, how are they different?",03:00,Taylor/Kent
711,Section_10,George Kent,"I do not think they are the same things. What former Vice President Biden requested of former President of Ukraine, Poroshenko, was the removal of a corrupt Prosecutor General, Victor Shokin, who had undermined a program of assistance that we had spent, again, US taxpayer money to try to build an independent investigator unit to go after corrupt prosecutors. And there was a case called the Diamond Prosecutor Case in which Shokin destroyed the entire ecosystem that we were trying to help create, the investigators, the judges who issued the warrants, the law enforcement that had warrants to do the wire tapping, everybody to protect his former driver who he’d made a prosecutor. That’s what Joe Biden was asking, remove the corrupt prosecutor so-",03:41,Taylor/Kent
712,Section_10,Jim Himes,"So Joe Biden was participating in an open effort, establish whole of government effort to address corruption in Ukraine?",04:31,Taylor/Kent
713,Section_10,George Kent,That is correct.,04:38,Taylor/Kent
714,Section_10,Jim Himes,"Great. So, Mr. Kent, as you look at this whole mess, Rudy Giuliani, President Trump, in your opinion, was this a comprehensive and whole of government effort to end corruption in Ukraine?",04:39,Taylor/Kent
715,Section_10,George Kent,Referring to the requests in July?,04:51,Taylor/Kent
716,Section_10,Jim Himes,Exactly.,04:53,Taylor/Kent
717,Section_10,George Kent,"I would not say so. No, sir.",04:54,Taylor/Kent
718,Section_10,Jim Himes,"Yeah, I don’t think President Trump was trying to end corruption in Ukraine. I think he was trying to aim corruption in Ukraine at Vice President Biden and at the 2020 election. And I yield back the balance of my time.",04:56,Taylor/Kent
719,Section_10,Andre Carson,"Thank you, chairman. My colleague touched briefly on the campaign to remove career diplomat, Ambassador Yovanovitch. Mr. Kent, you stated in previous testimony that you were aware of the “campaign of slander” against the ambassador in real time, which basically unfolded in the media. Where do you understand this misinformation campaign was coming from and who was essentially perpetuating it?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
720,Section_11,George Kent,"To my understanding, the then prosecutor general of Ukraine, now ex, Yuriy Lutsenko, met Rudy Giuliani in New York on a private visit in January. They had a second meeting in February. And through the good offices of the former mayor of New York, Yuriy Lutsenko gave an interview to John Solomon, then of The Hill, in early March, and the campaign was launched on March 20th.",00:24,Taylor/Kent
721,Section_11,Andre Carson,"A corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor gave an interview to a reporter in the United States and made claims that the ambassador provided officials with a “do not prosecute” list. Sir, do you have any reason to believe this is true?",00:55,Taylor/Kent
722,Section_11,George Kent,I have every reason to believe it is not true.,01:10,Taylor/Kent
723,Section_11,Andre Carson,"What was the reputation of the man who made these allegations, sir?",01:12,Taylor/Kent
724,Section_11,George Kent,"Yuriy Lutsenko was a politician of longstanding. He had been Minister of Interior after the Orange Revolution. The U.S. Embassy had good relations with him for years. He was imprisoned by President Yanukovych, came out, was elected majority leader of Poroshenko, the then president’s party, and then became prosecutor general in the spring of 2016.",01:16,Taylor/Kent
725,Section_11,Andre Carson,"What was your experience with Ambassador Yovanovitch? Was she working hard to combat corruption in Ukraine, sir?",01:37,Taylor/Kent
726,Section_11,George Kent,"She was dedicated, as is every U.S. government official in Ukraine, to help Ukrainians to overcome the legacy of corruption, which they actually have made a number of important steps since 2014.",01:43,Taylor/Kent
727,Section_11,Andre Carson,"So, in fact, before all of this happened, you and your superiors at the State Department asked the ambassador to extend her time in the Ukraine, correct, sir?",01:55,Taylor/Kent
728,Section_11,George Kent,That is correct.,02:04,Taylor/Kent
729,Section_11,Andre Carson,Did you support her extension?,02:05,Taylor/Kent
730,Section_11,George Kent,"I asked her to extend until the end of this year to get through the election cycle in Ukraine, and then Under Secretary Hale, in March, asked her to stay until 2020.",02:07,Taylor/Kent
731,Section_11,Andre Carson,Now some in Ukraine probably disliked her efforts to help Ukraine root out corruption. Is that correct?,02:16,Taylor/Kent
732,Section_11,George Kent,"As I mentioned in my testimony, you can’t promote a principled anti-corruption action without pissing off corrupt people.",02:21,Taylor/Kent
733,Section_11,Andre Carson,"Fair enough. Now, some of those people helped Giuliani smear her, did they not?",02:29,Taylor/Kent
734,Section_11,George Kent,They did.,02:37,Taylor/Kent
735,Section_11,Andre Carson,"Ultimately that smear campaign pushed President Trump to remove her, correct, sir?",02:38,Taylor/Kent
736,Section_11,George Kent,I cannot judge that. What I can say is that Rudy Giuliani’s smear campaign was ubiquitous in the spring of 2019 on Fox News and on the Internet and Twittersphere.,02:43,Taylor/Kent
737,Section_11,Andre Carson,"So Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, in all of your combined decades at the State Department, have you ever before seen an instance where an ambassador was forced out by the president following a smear campaign of misinformation orchestrated by the president’s allies?",02:52,Taylor/Kent
738,Section_11,George Kent,I have not.,03:09,Taylor/Kent
739,Section_11,Bill Taylor,Nor I.,03:10,Taylor/Kent
740,Section_11,Andre Carson,"Mr. Chairman, I yield back.",03:11,Taylor/Kent
741,Section_11,Michael Turner,"Mr. Kent, Ambassador Taylor. Thank you for your service. I have a great deal of appreciation for your profession. You have very little direct contact with decision makers, a tremendous amount of responsibility. And not a lot of authority to affect U.S. policy, bilateral engagements or multilateral engagements, you’re trying to shepherd through issues with our allies.",00:00,Taylor/Kent
742,Section_12,Michael Turner,"One example of that, Ambassador Taylor, is that you who testified in your prior testimony that you have not had any contact with the President of the United States. Is that correct?",00:22,Taylor/Kent
743,Section_12,Bill Taylor,"That’s correct, sir.",00:30,Taylor/Kent
744,Section_12,Michael Turner,"Mr. Taylor, Mr. Kent, have you had any contact with President of the United States?",00:31,Taylor/Kent
745,Section_12,George Kent,I have not.,00:34,Taylor/Kent
746,Section_12,Michael Turner,"So not only, no conversations with the President of the United States about Ukraine. You’ve not had any contact with the President of the United States, correct?",00:35,Taylor/Kent
747,Section_12,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,00:43,Taylor/Kent
748,Section_12,Michael Turner,"Okay, so you both know that this impeachment inquiry is about the President of the United States, don’t you? I mean, the man that neither one of you have had any contact with, you’re the first up witnesses. I just find that a little amazing, that the first up, would be two people who have never had any contact with the President himself.",00:43,Taylor/Kent
749,Section_12,Michael Turner,"Now, Kurt Volker did have contact with the President, and contact with President on Ukraine. Mr., Ambassador Taylor, you said that he’s a man of highest integrity. Well, I know Kurt Volker, and I know he served as the NATO ambassador. He served as the Director of the McCain Institute. He’s of the highest professional ethics, one of the most knowledgeable people about Europe. He’s absolutely a truthful man. Mr. Kent, would you agree with Ambassador Taylor, that he’s of the highest integrity?",01:02,Taylor/Kent
750,Section_12,George Kent,"I believe Kurt Volker has served the U.S. as a public servant, very well.",01:28,Taylor/Kent
751,Section_12,Michael Turner,"Do either of you have any evidence that Mr. Volker committed perjury, or lied to this Committee in his testimony to this committee? Do either of you have any evidence that Kurt Volker perjured himself, or lied to this Committee, in his testimony? Ambassador Taylor, any evidence?",01:33,Taylor/Kent
752,Section_12,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Turner, I have no evidence.",01:49,Taylor/Kent
753,Section_12,Michael Turner,Mr. Kent?,01:53,Taylor/Kent
754,Section_12,George Kent,"I believe Ambassador Volker’s deposition was over 400 pages, and I don’t have it in front of me, so I can’t [crosstalk 00:02:01]-",01:54,Taylor/Kent
755,Section_12,Michael Turner,"But you have no evidence that he lied or perjured himself, correct, Mr. Kent?",02:01,Taylor/Kent
756,Section_12,George Kent,"I have no basis to make that judgment, no sir.",02:03,Taylor/Kent
757,Section_12,Michael Turner,"Great. Well, we’re not in a court, gentlemen, and if we were, the Sixth Amendment would apply, and so would rules on hearsay and opinion. And most of your two testimonies would not be admissible, whatsoever. But I understand, in your profession, you deal in words of understanding. Words of beliefs and feelings, because in your profession, that’s what you work with to try to pull together policy, and to go in and out of meetings to try to formulate opinions that affect other people’s decision making.",02:06,Taylor/Kent
758,Section_12,Michael Turner,"Ambassador Taylor, have you ever prepared for a meeting with a President or a Prime Minister of a country, where you were told one thing before you went into the meeting as to what it was to be about, and the meeting be about another thing? Or you get in there, and the beliefs or opinions of the President or the Prime Minister, were other than you believed?",02:33,Taylor/Kent
759,Section_12,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Turner, you’re asking if I ever learned something new in a meeting-",02:52,Taylor/Kent
760,Section_12,Michael Turner,"Right, have you ever walked in with a belief that you thought about the country that you were serving in, and find out that they were wrong?",02:55,Taylor/Kent
761,Section_12,Bill Taylor,"… I learn something in every meeting, Mr. Turner. But I, you know [crosstalk 00:03:09]-",03:02,Taylor/Kent
762,Section_12,Michael Turner,"Well, Ambassador Taylor, the reason why the Sixth Amendment doesn’t allow hearsay, is because it’s unreliable. It’s unreliable because frequently, it’s untruthful. It is not factual. It might be beliefs or understandings. Ambassador, you testified about a number of things that you heard. Isn’t it true, possible, that the things that you heard were not true? That some of the beliefs and understandings that you had, are not accurate? That in fact, you’re mistaken about some of the things that you testified today, on a factual basis, versus a professional assessment?",03:06,Taylor/Kent
763,Section_12,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Turner, I am here to tell you what I know. I’m not going to tell you anything I don’t know. I’m going to tell you everything that I do know, and that’s-",03:35,Taylor/Kent
764,Section_12,Michael Turner,"But since you learned it from others, you could-",03:43,Taylor/Kent

766,Section_12,Michael Turner,"… you could be right, you could be wrong, right-",03:44,Taylor/Kent
767,Section_12,Bill Taylor,… That’s exactly why I’m here.,03:44,Taylor/Kent
768,Section_12,Michael Turner,… Mr. Taylor?,03:46,Taylor/Kent
769,Section_12,Michael Turner,"But since you learned it from others, you could be wrong. Correct?",03:47,Taylor/Kent
770,Section_12,Bill Taylor,I am telling you what I heard them tell me.,03:51,Taylor/Kent
771,Section_12,Michael Turner,"And they could be wrong, or they could be mistaken, or they could have heard it incorrectly. Right, Ambassador Taylor?",03:53,Taylor/Kent
772,Section_12,Bill Taylor,"People make mistakes, [crosstalk 00:00:04:01].",04:01,Taylor/Kent

774,Section_12,Rep. M. Quigley,"That certification that took place in May, is that correct, Mr. Kent?",00:01,Taylor/Kent
775,Section_12,George Kent,"Do not believe it was certified by May. I would defer to my colleague, Laura Cooper, who has testified [crosstalk 00:00:11] unclosed door, [crosstalk 00:00:12] but-",00:04,Taylor/Kent
776,Section_12,Rep. M. Quigley,It was an earlier time-,00:11,Taylor/Kent

779,Section_12,George Kent,"Yes, sir. I think it may have been in the July timeframe.",00:23,Taylor/Kent
780,Section_12,Rep. M. Quigley,"Thank you. It’s interesting, and curious, that we’re talking about hearsay evidence. And it is extraordinary to me that the committee has been able to get as much information as they had, direct or hearsay, given the obstruction. You gentlemen were both asked, by the state department, not to appear for your depositions, is that correct?",00:25,Taylor/Kent
781,Section_12,George Kent,"We both received, I believe, I received initially a letter directing me not to appear. And once the committees issued a subpoena, I was under legal obligation to appear, and I am here today under subpoena.",00:46,Taylor/Kent

783,Section_12,Bill Taylor,"[inaudible 00:01:08] I was told, by the state department, don’t appear under these circumstances, that was in the letter to me, and when I got the subpoena, exactly is as Mr. Kent said, that was different circumstances and a beta legal subpoena, so, yes sir, I’m here for that reason.",01:08,Taylor/Kent
784,Section_12,Rep. M. Quigley,"Absolutely, but we were not able to hear testimony by Chief of Staff Mulvaney, John Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, John Bolton, more than a dozen witnesses, so I suspect if you have a problem with hearsay you’d have a lot more direct testimony and direct evidence if you weren’t blocking that ability. You would have a lot more documents, documents that you referred to with my colleagues’ questions that have not yet been turned over by state or any other agency. Is that correct, to your knowledge, gentlemen?",01:25,Taylor/Kent
785,Section_12,George Kent,We’re both here under subpoena. I don’t think either of us is going to comment why others have not shown up.,01:59,Taylor/Kent

788,Section_12,Rep. M. Quigley,"Mr. Kent, following the July 25 call, and through the first two weeks of August, were you involved in any efforts to arrange for President Zelensky to make a statement announcing the two investigations that the president, President Trump had talked about in the July 25 call?",02:10,Taylor/Kent

794,Section_12,Rep. M. Quigley,"Andrea Yermack says that “Once we have a date, they will announce the investigations and Barisma and election meddling.” Mr Kent, are these the same two investigations President Trump asked the Ukrainian President to initiate in the July 25 call?",03:12,Taylor/Kent

The President can fire an ambassador for any reason whatsoever. A President can change his policy as he did when he opened the door for Turkey to go in and invade Kurdistan despite opposition from many of his senior advisors. A President could change his position and our position on Ukraine, but is there a limit? There is, because our Constitution says no one is above the law.",00:10,Taylor/Kent

811,Section_13,Peter Welch,"By the way, to my colleagues, if the President wants to attack Joe Biden and his son, he’s free to do it. All fair and square in campaigns. He’s just not free to change our foreign policy unless he gets his way to assist him in that campaign. That’s a line he can’t cross. Now, you all have been very clear about what our continuous foreign policy was. Ambassador Taylor, just very quickly describe why us withholding aid interfered with achieving our national security goals.",01:38,Taylor/Kent
812,Section_13,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Welch, one of our national security goals is to resolve conflicts in Europe. There is one major conflict in Europe. It’s a fighting war. Our national security goals in support of Ukraine, in support of a broader strategic approach to Europe is to facilitate that negotiation.",02:19,Taylor/Kent
813,Section_13,Peter Welch,Right.,02:46,Taylor/Kent
814,Section_13,Bill Taylor,Is to try to support Ukraine when it negotiates with the Russians.,02:46,Taylor/Kent
815,Section_13,Peter Welch,"Right. I want to go back, because in the historical context, Mister Kent, that you and Ambassador Taylor provided, we had 70 years of peace after the war in which we lost over 400,000 American lives. That took care. That was in jeopardy, as you described it, Ambassador Taylor, and that threatened each and every one of us up here and the constituents we represent. Is that a fair statement?",02:50,Taylor/Kent
816,Section_13,Bill Taylor,That’s a fair statement.,03:19,Taylor/Kent
817,Section_13,Peter Welch,"I want to do three dates too. I only have a little time, but July 24, July 25 and July 26. July 24th, Director Mueller testified about his investigation and he established beyond doubt that it was the Russians who interfered in our election. He expressed a fear that would be the new normal. On July 25th, according to the readout of the President’s campaign, he asked the Ukrainians to investigate Ukrainian interference in our election that had been repudiated. Then in July 26th, as I understand it, this person who reported to you heard the President saying he wanted investigations again in Ukraine.",03:22,Taylor/Kent
818,Section_13,Peter Welch,"So, this is the question. The new normal that Director Mueller feared, is there a new normal that you fear that a president, any president, can use congressionally approved foreign aid as a lever to get personal advantage in something that is in his interest but not the public interest?",04:17,Taylor/Kent
819,Section_13,Bill Taylor,"That should not be the case, Mr. Welch.",04:43,Taylor/Kent
820,Section_13,Denny Heck,"Mr Kent. Some people have suggested that the real reason that president Trump’s pressure campaign on the Ukraine was to root out corruption in Ukraine. I’ve gone back and read the memorandum of call two or three times actually, and I don’t recall a single instance where the president ever used the word corruption, nor the word corrupt.",00:00,Taylor/Kent
821,Section_14,Denny Heck,"I know in answer to the chairman’s opening questions, you’d indicated you had gone back and read it about a month ago. Do you recall the president in that July 25th phone call with President Zelensky ever uttering the word corrupt or corruption?",00:29,Taylor/Kent
822,Section_14,George Kent,"I don’t recall, but it would be a matter of record now that it’s been released.",00:43,Taylor/Kent
823,Section_14,Denny Heck,"And as a matter of record he didn’t, but he did manage to find time to mention his potential political rival in 2020.",00:46,Taylor/Kent
824,Section_14,Denny Heck,"You also answered, in response to the question from Mr Himes, that you’ve been working on the issue of corruption, literally for decades. I thank you for that on behalf of the american people. And indeed, on October 15th you testified about longstanding US policy meant to combat corruption in the Ukraine, championed by people such as former ambassador Maria Ivanovich. But Mr Kent, is it not true that, rather than fighting corruption in general and Ukraine, that what President Trump actually did was unceremoniously recall and remove Ambassador Ivanovich from her post in Ukraine?",00:54,Taylor/Kent
825,Section_14,George Kent,"I would, say first of all as I repeated before, a president has the right to recall ambassadors. It remains a matter of policy of the United States towards Ukraine to help them overcome a legacy of corruption in creating new institutions. And much of what we’ve been discussing today, which involved in a regular channel, was a request that went against US policy that would have undermined the rule of law and our longstanding policy goals in Ukraine, as in other countries in the post-Soviet space.",01:37,Taylor/Kent
826,Section_14,Denny Heck,"Those policies, which were indeed championed by ambassador Ivanovich.",02:08,Taylor/Kent
827,Section_14,Denny Heck,"You also testified on October 15th in the deposition about fundamental reforms necessary for Ukraine to fight corruption and to transform the country. And you cited the importance of reforming certain institutions, notably the security service in the Prosecutor General’s office. Was investigating President Trump’s political opponents a part of those necessary reforms? Was it on that list of yours, sir, or indeed, was it on any list?",02:11,Taylor/Kent
828,Section_14,George Kent,"No, they weren’t.",02:45,Taylor/Kent
829,Section_14,Denny Heck,"In fact, historically, is it not true that a major problem in the Ukraine has been it’s misuse of prosecutors, precisely to conduct investigation of political opponents? That’s a legacy I dare suggest from the Soviet era when, as you stated in your testimony, prosecutors like the KGB were, and I quote you now, “Instruments of oppression.” Is that true?",02:47,Taylor/Kent
830,Section_14,George Kent,"I said that, and I believe it’s true.",03:11,Taylor/Kent
831,Section_14,Denny Heck,"So finally, Mr. Kent, for as long as I can remember, US foreign policy has been predicated on advancing principled entrance and democratic values, notably freedom of speech, press, assembly, religion, free fair and open elections, and the rule of law. Mr. Kent, when American leaders ask foreign governments to investigate their potential rivals, doesn’t that make it harder for us to advocate on behalf of those democratic values?",03:13,Taylor/Kent
832,Section_14,George Kent,"I believe it makes it more difficult for our diplomatic representatives overseas to carry out those policy goals, yes.",03:54,Taylor/Kent
833,Section_14,Denny Heck,"How is that, sir?",04:00,Taylor/Kent
834,Section_14,George Kent,"Well, there’s a issue of credibility. They hear diplomats on the ground saying one thing, and they hear other US leaders saying something else.",04:02,Taylor/Kent
835,Section_14,Denny Heck,"Ambassador Taylor, would you agree with that, sir?",04:10,Taylor/Kent
836,Section_14,Bill Taylor,I would.,04:12,Taylor/Kent
837,Section_14,Denny Heck,"Is there anything you’d like to add about how it might make it more difficult for you to do your job, sir?",04:13,Taylor/Kent
838,Section_14,Bill Taylor,"Our credibility is based on a respect for the United States, and if we damage that respect, then it hurts our credibility and makes it more difficult for us to do our jobs.",04:20,Taylor/Kent
839,Section_14,Denny Heck,"Anyone looking at the facts can see what happened was an abuse of power. Anyone looking at the facts can see that what happened was unethical. Anyone looking at the facts can see, anyone looking at the facts can see that what went on was just plain wrong.",04:33,Taylor/Kent
840,Section_14,John Ratcliffe,"Thank you both for being here. It’s obvious from your testimony today that you both care a great deal about U.S, Ukraine relations. It’s also very clear that you’re optimistic about president Zelensky. Ambassador Taylor, you relayed one of his first acts in office was to remove immunity from deputies, which had long been a source of corruption. I know you had a number of personal dealings with him. Has he given you any reason to question his honesty or his integrity?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
841,Section_15,Bill Taylor,No sir.,00:24,Taylor/Kent
842,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,"In your prior deposition, I asked you, and I’ll read it directly, “If nobody in the Ukrainian government is aware of a military hold at the time of the Trump, Zelensky call then as a matter of law, and as a matter of fact, there can be no quid pro quo based on military aid. And to your knowledge, nobody in the Ukrainian government was aware of the hold.” And your answer was, that is correct. Is that still your testimony?",00:25,Taylor/Kent
843,Section_15,Bill Taylor,Mr. Ratcliffe at some point in September …,00:51,Taylor/Kent
844,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,I’m talking about on July 25th.,00:56,Taylor/Kent
845,Section_15,Bill Taylor,"July 25th sorry. Yes, that’s correct. That’s correct. They did not know this.",00:58,Taylor/Kent
846,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,"All right. And as it turns out, president Zelensky agreed with you. On October 10th president Zelensky held a press marathon with over 300 reporters where he said repeatedly and consistently over hours and hours that he was not aware of a military hold during the July 25th call. In fact, in his official press release from the Ukrainian government, available on his website that I’ll be introducing into the record, he said, “Our phone conversation bears no relations to arms. They blocked the provision of military assistance prior to our telephone conversation, but the issue had not been discussed during our conversation. I mean, I didn’t even know.” Now, in addition to confirming that because he had no knowledge of it, there was no quid pro quo involving military aid during that call. President Zelensky went on to confirm a number of things that there was no pressure, that there were no conditions, that there were no threats on military aid. There were no conditions or pressure to investigate Burisma or the 2016 election. That there was no blackmail. That there was no corruption of any kind during the July 25th call, again, from his official press release.",01:02,Taylor/Kent
847,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,"Therefore, there was no blackmail because it was not the subject of our conversation with the president of the United States. There were no conditions on the investigation, either because of arms or the situation around Burisma company. He told [inaudible 00:02:35] there was no blackmail. He told the L.A. Times there was no pressure or blackmail from the United States. He told Japan’s Kyoto news, “I was never pressured and there were no conditions being imposed.” He told ABC news and the BBC, “I’m against corruption. This is not corruption. It was just a call.”",02:20,Taylor/Kent
848,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,"The Ukrainian president stood in front of the world press and repeatedly, consistently over and over again, interview after interview said he had no knowledge of military aid being withheld. Meaning no quid pro quo, no pressure, no demands, no threats, no blackmail, nothing corrupt. And unlike the first 45 minutes that we heard from the Democrats today, that’s not secondhand information. It’s not hearsay, it’s not what someone overheard ambassador Sandlin say, that was his direct testimony. Ambassador Taylor, do you have any evidence to assert that president Zelensky was lying to the world press when he said those things? Yes or no?",02:57,Taylor/Kent
849,Section_15,Bill Taylor,Mr. Ratcliffe if I can respond …,03:34,Taylor/Kent
850,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,"My time is short, yes or no.",03:36,Taylor/Kent
851,Section_15,Bill Taylor,That’s right. I have no reason to doubt what the president said in his press conference.,03:38,Taylor/Kent
852,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,"Okay, very good. In this impeachment hearing today where we impeach presidents for treason or bribery or other high crimes, where is the impeachable offense in that call? Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call? Shout it out. Anyone?",03:44,Taylor/Kent
853,Section_15,Bill Taylor,Mr. Ratcliffe if I can just respond. Let me just reiterate that I’m not here …,04:05,Taylor/Kent
854,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,I’ve got one minute left.,04:13,Taylor/Kent
855,Section_15,Bill Taylor,I know you only got a minute left.,04:13,Taylor/Kent
856,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,Let me just make this point.,04:13,Taylor/Kent
857,Section_15,Speaker 3,You asked the witness a question.,04:14,Taylor/Kent
858,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,I withdraw the question. Let me just make this point …,04:14,Taylor/Kent
859,Section_15,Bill Taylor,"I’m not here to take one side or the other, that’s your [crosstalk 00:04:20].",04:16,Taylor/Kent
860,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,Let me ask this question …,04:16,Taylor/Kent
861,Section_15,Speaker 3,The general will suspend.,04:21,Taylor/Kent
862,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,Suspend the time please.,04:22,Taylor/Kent
863,Section_15,Speaker 3,"Ambassador Taylor, would you like to answer the question?",04:24,Taylor/Kent
864,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,Suspend the time please. I withdrew the question.,04:27,Taylor/Kent
865,Section_15,Speaker 3,The general will suspend. We will suspend the clock.,04:28,Taylor/Kent
866,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,Suspend the clock in one minute please.,04:31,Taylor/Kent
867,Section_15,Speaker 3,"Ambassador Taylor, would you like toe respond to the question?",04:33,Taylor/Kent
868,Section_15,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Ratcliffe, I would just like to say that I am not here to do anything having to do with having to decide about impeachment. That is not what either of us are here to do. This is your job. Thank you Mr. General.",04:36,Taylor/Kent
869,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,Will you restore time to the clock to one minute?,04:48,Taylor/Kent
870,Section_15,Speaker 3,"No, but you may continue with 22 seconds.",04:50,Taylor/Kent
871,Section_15,John Ratcliffe,"Fine. Mr. Ambassador, I think everyone knows that house Democrats have made up their mind to impeach one president. The question that we’ve just learned is whether or not they’re prepared to impeach two. Because to be clear, if house Democrats impeach president Trump for a quid pro quo involving military aid, they have to call president Zelensky a liar. If they impeach him for abusing his power, or pressuring, or making threats or demands, they have to call president Zelensky a liar to do it. If they impeach president Trump for blackmail or extortion, or making threats or demands, they have to call president Trump a liar to do it.",04:55,Taylor/Kent
872,Section_15,Joaquin Castro,"Thank you chairman. Thank you gentlemen for your testimony today and for your service to our country. Listening to all the evidence, everything I’ve heard and read in this investigation, it seems to me that the President of the United States either committed extortion and bribery of a foreign official or attempted extortion and bribery of a foreign official. When President Trump got President Zelensky on the phone on July 25th, he was talking to a desperate man, wasn’t he? President Zelensky was desperate to protect his country and make sure that he had foreign assistance from the United States. Is that right?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
873,Section_16,Bill Taylor,"President Zelensky is very interested in U.S. support, both assistance and political support.",00:38,Taylor/Kent
874,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,"What would have happened if the aid had gotten cut off, ambassador? What would have happened to President Zelensky’s career, and what would’ve happened to the Ukraine?",00:44,Taylor/Kent
875,Section_16,Bill Taylor,"If the assistance had been cut off, he would have been much weaker in his negotiations with the Russians. He would have been much weaker on the battlefield.",00:51,Taylor/Kent
876,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,"The Russians may have taken it as an invitation to actually take military action against Ukraine, is that right?",01:07,Taylor/Kent
877,Section_16,Bill Taylor,"The Russians always look for vulnerabilities and they know that the United States has supported Ukraine. If the Russians determine or suspect that that support is lessened or not there, they will likely take advantage.",01:13,Taylor/Kent
878,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,They could have pounced.,01:30,Taylor/Kent
879,Section_16,Bill Taylor,They could have taken advantage.,01:31,Taylor/Kent
880,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,"So he had a desperate man on the phone and he asked a desperate man for a favor. And based on your testimony, it sounds like begrudgingly President’s Zelensky may have actually agreed to do that favor and investigate the Bidens and Burisma. Is that right?",01:33,Taylor/Kent
881,Section_16,Bill Taylor,Presidents Zelensky does say in the transcript that he will pursue the investigations.,01:50,Taylor/Kent
882,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,"So we know that President Trump asked for a favor to help his political career, and it appears as though the president of the Ukraine agreed to that favor. Do we know why it didn’t actually happen?",01:55,Taylor/Kent
883,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,Do we know why there was no announcement in front of CNN or to CNN about an investigation?,02:09,Taylor/Kent
884,Section_16,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Castro, as we’ve determined, as we’ve discussed here, on September 11th, just before any CNN discussion or interview, the hold was released. The hold on the security systems was released.",02:20,Taylor/Kent
885,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,So the hold was released. Is it possible that the White House released that hold because they knew that a whistle blower had basically turned this in?,02:39,Taylor/Kent
886,Section_16,Bill Taylor,"I don’t know, sir.",02:49,Taylor/Kent
887,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,Do you think that’s possible?,02:51,Taylor/Kent
888,Section_16,Bill Taylor,I’m not in a position to judge.,02:53,Taylor/Kent
889,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,"So we have a president who the other side claimed or has defended the president saying that the aid went through, that there was never any investigation, but the president attempted to get those things done, and it looks like there was an initial agreement by the President of the Ukraine to actually do those things.",02:55,Taylor/Kent
890,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,"So, ambassadors, is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted murder a crime?",03:16,Taylor/Kent
891,Section_16,Bill Taylor,Attempted murder is a crime.,03:27,Taylor/Kent
892,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,Is attempted robbery a crime?,03:28,Taylor/Kent
893,Section_16,Bill Taylor,"Neither of us is a lawyer, but I-",03:31,Taylor/Kent
894,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,I think anybody in this room could answer that question.,03:34,Taylor/Kent
895,Section_16,Bill Taylor,"I think that’s right, and I’ll go out on a limb and say yes it is.",03:36,Taylor/Kent
896,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,Is attempted extortion and bribery a crime?,03:39,Taylor/Kent
897,Section_16,Bill Taylor,"I don’t know, sir.",03:43,Taylor/Kent
898,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,"In the minute that I have left, I want you to speak to the nation about what’s at stake, Ambassador Kent. You said in your opening statement, you warned about selective prosecutions and a president of the United States going after specific Americans abroad. If this Congress clears President Trump, does it mean that he can go ask another foreign country to investigate another presidential candidate, a member of Congress, a governor, a Senator, or any private American citizen doing business overseas? If there’s no consequence for a president who does that, then it means there’s a green light, doesn’t it? For any president to ask any country to go prosecute or investigate an American citizen for political and personal gain of that president, doesn’t it?",03:49,Taylor/Kent
899,Section_16,George Kent,"Thank you for the question. First of all, I’m not an ambassador.",04:46,Taylor/Kent
900,Section_16,Joaquin Castro,"I’m sorry, Deputy-",04:49,Taylor/Kent
901,Section_16,George Kent,"I will repeat, I think on principle, regardless of the country, whether it’s Ukraine, the U.S. or any country, the facts of law, criminal nexus should drive investigations by law enforcement officials and it is not the role of politicians to be involved in directing the judicial systems of their own country or other countries.",04:50,Taylor/Kent
902,Section_16,Bill Taylor,[inaudible 00:05:13].,05:11,Taylor/Kent
903,Section_16,Rep. Demings,"Mr. Kent, you said that a president has the right to remove an ambassador because the ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the president. Is that correct?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
904,Section_17,George Kent,"That is correct, ma’am.",00:09,Taylor/Kent
905,Section_17,Rep. Demings,Does that removal usually come with a smear campaign of that ambassador by the president?,00:10,Taylor/Kent
906,Section_17,George Kent,I think the right of the president to make a decision about the president’s personal representative as confirmed by the senate is separate from whatever happens outside the confines of U.S. government processes.,00:18,Taylor/Kent
907,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"You have any idea why it was important to discredit Ambassador Yovanovitch, what she was not willing to do or to do? Why that was important?",00:29,Taylor/Kent
908,Section_17,George Kent,"Well, I guess it probably depends on the motivation of other people and I am not one of them.",00:39,Taylor/Kent
909,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"The committee’s investigation has uncovered a web of shadow diplomacy, engaged in and executed by several State Department officials and the president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and ultimately directed by President Trump. We have heard several ways of describing this shady shadow operation, shadow diplomacy, rogue back channel.",00:45,Taylor/Kent
910,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"Ambassador Taylor, you have described what you encountered as the top diplomat on the ground in Ukraine, as a, and I quote, “highly irregular informal channel of U.S. policy making.” You testified that the channel included Ambassador Volker, Sondland, Secretary Perry, and, as you later learned, the president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Is that correct?",01:09,Taylor/Kent
911,Section_17,Bill Taylor,"Yes, ma’am.",01:33,Taylor/Kent
912,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"Both of you have explained that you grew seriously concerned when you realized that the interests of this irregular channel diverge from official U.S. policy and interests. Was Mr. Giuliani promoting U.S. national interests or policy in Ukraine, Ambassador?",01:34,Taylor/Kent
913,Section_17,Bill Taylor,I don’t think so ma’am.,01:52,Taylor/Kent
914,Section_17,Rep. Demings,Mr. Kent?,01:54,Taylor/Kent
915,Section_17,George Kent,"No, he was not.",01:55,Taylor/Kent
916,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"What interests do you believe he was promoting, Mr. Kent?",01:57,Taylor/Kent
917,Section_17,George Kent,I believe he was looking to dig up political dirt against a potential rival in the next election cycle.,02:01,Taylor/Kent
918,Section_17,Rep. Demings,Ambassador Taylor? What interests do you believe he was promoting?,02:08,Taylor/Kent
919,Section_17,Bill Taylor,I agree with Mr. Kent.,02:13,Taylor/Kent
920,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"The State Department’s role is to promote U.S. policies overseas, not to help the current president win reelection. Is that correct, Mr. Kent?",02:16,Taylor/Kent
921,Section_17,George Kent,All federal government employees are subject to the Hatch Act and our actions are supposed to be promoting policy and not involved in partisan politics.,02:26,Taylor/Kent

923,Section_17,Bill Taylor,I agree.,02:34,Taylor/Kent
924,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"What is the risk of running a separate channel of diplomacy that is completely outside of normal channels and does not further U.S. policy goals, Ambassador Taylor?",02:36,Taylor/Kent
925,Section_17,Bill Taylor,"That means it’s possible to do one but not the other. That is, if it’s completely against U.S. policy goals, then that’s a mistake, then it’s not helpful. You can go, you can get advice and even have conversations outside of the normal channels, but then they need to be part of U.S. foreign policy and approaching those goals.",02:48,Taylor/Kent
926,Section_17,Rep. Demings,Mr. Kent?,03:12,Taylor/Kent
927,Section_17,George Kent,Agree.,03:14,Taylor/Kent
928,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"Ambassador Taylor, you have described in your previous testimony, one instance shortly after you arrived in Ukraine, in which Ambassador Sondland asked State Department officials not to listen to a July 28th call he had planned to hold with President Zelinsky. Did you find that unusual?",03:15,Taylor/Kent
929,Section_17,Bill Taylor,I did.,03:32,Taylor/Kent
930,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"What was the impact of Ambassador Sondland making that request? You found it unusual, what did you believe the impact was?",03:33,Taylor/Kent
931,Section_17,Bill Taylor,"Ms. Demings, I’m not sure there was an immediate impact.",03:43,Taylor/Kent
932,Section_17,Rep. Demings,Was there a recording or transcription?,03:46,Taylor/Kent
933,Section_17,Bill Taylor,"There was not. That was the impact, it was not recorded.",03:49,Taylor/Kent
934,Section_17,Rep. Demings,Do you think that’s why the request was made? So there would not be normal State Department employees from the operations center would have been there transcribing and taking notes.,03:51,Taylor/Kent
935,Section_17,Bill Taylor,"That is the norm, but it is not unusual to not have it recorded.",04:04,Taylor/Kent
936,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"So you know that the State Department is holding your notes and refuses to provide them to Congress despite a duly authorized subpoena, and we know that, in some instances, your notes may be the only documentary record of what happened. You are aware of that, correct?",04:12,Taylor/Kent
937,Section_17,Bill Taylor,"Yes, ma’am.",04:31,Taylor/Kent
938,Section_17,Rep. Demings,"And Mr. Kent, you are aware that your notes have not been turned over to Congress.",04:31,Taylor/Kent

940,Section_17,Terri Sewell,"I’d like to refer you to the discussion of the May 23rd meeting in the Oval Office when the president met with those who had gone to the Ukraine for the inauguration. You briefly testified that you helped propose names for individuals to go to that inauguration. Was ambassador Sunderland, who was ambassador to the European Union, one of the names that you submitted?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
941,Section_18,George Kent,"No, it was not.",00:26,Taylor/Kent
942,Section_18,Terri Sewell,But he ultimately attended that inauguration. Is that not right?,00:27,Taylor/Kent
943,Section_18,George Kent,That is correct.,00:31,Taylor/Kent
944,Section_18,Terri Sewell,And do you know how he ended up as a part of that official delegation?,00:32,Taylor/Kent
945,Section_18,George Kent,"I do not know for sure, but my understanding is, once the list left the NSC staff, it went through review through the part of the White House that determines presidential delegations.",00:36,Taylor/Kent

947,Section_18,George Kent,"That is my understanding, yes.",00:57,Taylor/Kent
948,Section_18,Terri Sewell,"It seems that this Oval Office meeting was a pivotal turning point in the Ukraine policy. Coming out of that meeting, who was given responsibility to your recollection? Who was given responsibility for the Ukraine policy?",00:58,Taylor/Kent
949,Section_18,George Kent,"I never saw any document that changed the nature of policy determination. In the US government, under the Trump Administration, there’s the National Security Presidential-",01:13,Taylor/Kent
950,Section_18,Terri Sewell,"But didn’t you also say,",01:22,Taylor/Kent
951,Section_18,George Kent,Yes please.,01:24,Taylor/Kent
952,Section_18,Terri Sewell,"Have a little time. You did say in your testimony that you felt that that… You testified that Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sunderland and Ambassador Volker “felt that they had a mandate to take the lead” on Ukraine policy. Did you not?",01:24,Taylor/Kent
953,Section_18,George Kent,That was an accurate statement. Their feeling doesn’t mean that they actually got delegated responsibility.,01:42,Taylor/Kent
954,Section_18,Terri Sewell,Have you ever heard the term Three Amigos?,01:47,Taylor/Kent
955,Section_18,George Kent,I referenced that after watching Gordon Sunderland say that on Ukrainian TV on July 26.,01:50,Taylor/Kent
956,Section_18,Terri Sewell,And what do you come to mean by Three Amigos?,01:55,Taylor/Kent
957,Section_18,George Kent,"My understanding of Ambassador Sunderland’s use of that term is that the three people that were in charge of Ukraine policy during the summer were he, Gordon Sunderland, Ambassador Volker and Secretary Perry.",01:58,Taylor/Kent
958,Section_18,Terri Sewell,When did you come to learn about Mr. Giuliani’s role and what do you consider his role to have been?,02:12,Taylor/Kent
959,Section_18,George Kent,I first heard about former mayor Giuliani’s interest in Ukraine in January of this year. That was a different phase than what happened during the summertime.,02:19,Taylor/Kent
960,Section_18,Terri Sewell,Was it normal to have a person who is a private citizen take an active role in foreign diplomacy?,02:32,Taylor/Kent
961,Section_18,George Kent,"I did not find his particular engagement normal, no.",02:38,Taylor/Kent
962,Section_18,Terri Sewell,"Now, Mr. Ambassador Taylor, you testified that there are two channels, a regular and irregular. What did you see as Rudy Giuliani’s role in Ukraine policy?",02:42,Taylor/Kent
963,Section_18,Bill Taylor,I came to see that Mr. Giuliani had a large influence on the irregular channel.,02:56,Taylor/Kent
964,Section_18,Terri Sewell,And was that normal? Is that normal? To have a private citizen of the United States take an active role in diplomacy?,03:03,Taylor/Kent
965,Section_18,Bill Taylor,It is not normal. It is not unusual to ask for people outside the government to give opinions to help form the policies of the US government. It is unusual to have a person input into the channel that goes contrary to US policy.,03:11,Taylor/Kent
966,Section_18,Terri Sewell,Thank you. I’ll hear back.,03:29,Taylor/Kent
967,Section_18,Patrick Maloney,"Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you for being here today. Ambassador Taylor, what year did you graduate from West Point?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
968,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"1969, sir.",00:07,Taylor/Kent
969,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"It was the height of the Vietnam War, wasn’t it, sir?",00:09,Taylor/Kent
970,Section_19,Bill Taylor,The height was about that time.,00:12,Taylor/Kent
971,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"What was your class rank at West Point, sir?",00:15,Taylor/Kent
972,Section_19,Bill Taylor,I was number five.,00:18,Taylor/Kent
973,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,How many people were you in your class?,00:19,Taylor/Kent
974,Section_19,Bill Taylor,800.,00:21,Taylor/Kent
975,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"800 cadets, you were number five?",00:22,Taylor/Kent
976,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",00:24,Taylor/Kent
977,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"So when you’re top 1% of your class at West Point, you probably get your pick of assignments, but you picked the infantry didn’t you, sir?",00:25,Taylor/Kent
978,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"I did, sir. Yes, sir.",00:35,Taylor/Kent
979,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,You were a rifle company commander?,00:36,Taylor/Kent
980,Section_19,Bill Taylor,Sir.,00:38,Taylor/Kent
981,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,Where’d you serve?,00:39,Taylor/Kent
982,Section_19,Bill Taylor,In Vietnam.,00:41,Taylor/Kent
983,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"Did you see combat in Vietnam, sir?",00:41,Taylor/Kent
984,Section_19,Bill Taylor,I did.,00:44,Taylor/Kent
985,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,Did you earn any accommodations for that service?,00:44,Taylor/Kent
986,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"I was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, which is my highest I’m proudest of. There was a Bronze Star. There was a Air Medal with V.",00:49,Taylor/Kent
987,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"That’s for Valor, isn’t it, sir?",01:01,Taylor/Kent
988,Section_19,Bill Taylor,It is.,01:03,Taylor/Kent
989,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"Let’s talk about July 26th, a lot of years later. You go to the front, you’re go to Donbas with Ambassador Volker, I believe, and you’re on the bridge and you’re looking over on the front line at the Russian soldiers. Is that what you recall?",01:05,Taylor/Kent
990,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",01:22,Taylor/Kent
991,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"And you said the commander there, the Ukrainian commander thanked you for the American military assistance that you knew was being withheld at that moment.",01:24,Taylor/Kent
992,Section_19,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,01:34,Taylor/Kent
993,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"How’d that make you feel, sir?",01:35,Taylor/Kent
994,Section_19,Bill Taylor,Badly.,01:36,Taylor/Kent
995,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,Why?,01:37,Taylor/Kent
996,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Because it was clear that that commander counted on us. It was clear that that commander had confidence in us. It was clear that that commander had… was appreciative of the capabilities that he was given by that assistance, but also the reassurance that we were supporting him.",01:38,Taylor/Kent
997,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"You don’t strike me as a quitter ambassador, but you threatened to resign or you mentioned it in your statement. Before I ask you about that, let’s just talk about a couple of days later on July, excuse me, one month later on August 28th. You find yourself in Ukraine with the national security advisor, Mr. Bolton, right?",01:57,Taylor/Kent
998,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",02:17,Taylor/Kent
999,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,And you conveyed to him your concerns. You’ve testified to this previously about the withholding of military assistance. What does he say to you?,02:18,Taylor/Kent
1000,Section_19,Bill Taylor,He says that he shares my concern and he advises me to express that in a very special way to the secretary of state.,02:26,Taylor/Kent
1001,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"Now, he’s the national security advisor, works to directly with the president, but he tells you that you should bring it up with the secretary of state.",02:36,Taylor/Kent
1002,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",02:43,Taylor/Kent
1003,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"Have you ever sent a cable like that? How many times in your career of 40, 50 years have you sent a cable directly to the secretary of state?",02:43,Taylor/Kent
1004,Section_19,Bill Taylor,Once.,02:50,Taylor/Kent
1005,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,This time?,02:51,Taylor/Kent
1006,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",02:52,Taylor/Kent
1007,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,In 50 years?,02:53,Taylor/Kent
1008,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Rifle company commanders don’t send cables, but yes, sir.",02:55,Taylor/Kent
1009,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"So the national security advisor who can tell it to the president himself and who shares your concern says you the ambassador serving Ukraine should cable the secretary of state directly and you do so, don’t you?",02:58,Taylor/Kent
1010,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",03:11,Taylor/Kent
1011,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"What did the cable say, sir?",03:11,Taylor/Kent
1012,Section_19,Bill Taylor,It’s a classified cable.,03:15,Taylor/Kent
1013,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,Without going into classified information.,03:17,Taylor/Kent
1014,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Without going into classified it says security assistance. It’s what we’ve been talking about today. Security assistance to Ukraine at this particular time, as in previous time, is very important. I also make the point that we’ve also talked about here today. Ukraine is important for our national security and we should support it. Not to provide that would be folly.",03:18,Taylor/Kent
1015,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,Did you get an answer to your cable?,03:44,Taylor/Kent
1016,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"Not directly, no sir.",03:46,Taylor/Kent
1017,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,Do you know what happened to it?,03:48,Taylor/Kent
1018,Section_19,Bill Taylor,Secretary Kent-,03:51,Taylor/Kent
1019,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"Secretary Kent, do you know what happened to it?",03:52,Taylor/Kent
1020,Section_19,Bill Taylor,… tells me that-,03:54,Taylor/Kent
1021,Section_19,George Kent,"I was on vacation. I was on vacation when his cable came in, but my understanding is it made it to its recipient, intended recipient, Secretary Pompeo.",03:55,Taylor/Kent
1022,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,And we know Secretary Pompeo was on the call a month early on July 25th. It’s not like he’s in the dark about any of this. What did he do with it?,04:03,Taylor/Kent
1023,Section_19,George Kent,I honestly can’t say for sure what happened with the cable once the message was brought in at the highest level.,04:12,Taylor/Kent
1024,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"One other question, gentlemen. On September 1st you would call a meeting between the vice president and the president of Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky, in which right off the bat, the president of Ukraine raises security assistance. And the vice president, according to your telling says, “I’ll talk to the president tonight about that. I’ll make a call.” Do you know whether the vice president made that call?",04:18,Taylor/Kent
1025,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"I don’t know, sir.",04:40,Taylor/Kent
1026,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,"Do you know what, if anything, the vice president had to do with any of this? What more can you tell us about the vice president’s role in this? Do you know if he ever raised this issue with anyone in the administration, whether he ever pushed for the release of that security assistance?",04:41,Taylor/Kent
1027,Section_19,Bill Taylor,"I can’t, sir.",04:57,Taylor/Kent
1028,Section_19,George Kent,"I believe, to be the best of my understanding, the vice president was an advocate for the release of the assistance.",05:00,Taylor/Kent
1029,Section_19,Patrick Maloney,Thank you. [inaudible 00:05:08].,05:08,Taylor/Kent
1030,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"Thank you. To the witnesses, thank you. Time is precious, so I’m going to go very, very quickly.",00:01,Taylor/Kent
1031,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"Welcome, I think, to year four of the ongoing impeachment of President Trump. I’m sorry that you have been dragged into this. I think the sign behind me says it very well, by the whistleblower’s attorney: “The coup has started and impeachment will follow.”",00:06,Taylor/Kent
1032,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"But after listening for what is going on now four hours and 21 minutes, after all of the secret hearings, after all of the leaks, after hearing witnesses such as yourselves give your opinions, it really comes down to this one thing. One thing it comes down to. This is the transcript that the President has released of this phone call. There is one sentence, one phone call. That is what this entire impeachment proceeding is based upon. And I’ve got to tell you, if your impeachment case is so weak that you have to lie and exaggerate about it to convince the American people that they need to remove this President, then you’ve got a problem.",00:19,Taylor/Kent
1033,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"The American people have been lied to again and again on this. We first heard a lot about quid pro quo. And then many people realized that was meaningless. So, they said, “Let’s go for defenses then. Let’s talk about extortion. Let’s talk about bribery. Let’s talk about cover up and obstruction,” for which there is zero evidence of any of that. We heard a characterization of the President’s phone call that was so outrageously inaccurate it had to be described as a parody. And none of those things matter. None of it matters. It comes down to this.",00:59,Taylor/Kent
1034,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"We appreciate your insight, we appreciate your opinion; but all you can do is give your opinion of this. This one phone call.",01:28,Taylor/Kent
1035,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"Let me ask you, gentlemen: both of you have said here today, you have testified, “Corruption in the Ukraine is endemic.” Would we agree on that?",01:36,Taylor/Kent
1036,Section_19,Chris Stewart,Simple question. The problem is … Isn’t it?,01:46,Taylor/Kent
1037,Section_19,George Kent,"It’s a problem, and they’re taking steps to address it.",01:48,Taylor/Kent
1038,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"Okay. Earlier in the hearing, both of you said … Used the word “endemic” or agreed to it. It’s in the courts, it’s oligarchs, it’s prosecutors, it’s everywhere. And I think we can also agree that that’s not the only place in the world where we experience and see corruption. There’s dozens and dozens of nations around the world that are steeped in corruption. Would you agree with that?",01:51,Taylor/Kent
1039,Section_19,Speaker 3,"Mister, I would say that there’s corruption in every country, including ours.",02:12,Taylor/Kent
1040,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"Okay, thank you. And some we’re clearly more concerned about than others.",02:15,Taylor/Kent
1041,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"So, in these corrupt nations, of which there are probably hundreds of corrupt individuals, hundreds of corrupt government officials, can you give me an example of any time where the Vice President of the United States shows up and demands that a specific prosecutor be fired and gives them a six hour time limit to do that? Are you aware of that ever happening in any other place?",02:19,Taylor/Kent
1042,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"I guess the answer is “no”. And I just think it’s interesting that out of hundreds of corrupt individuals, dozens of corrupt nations, that happened one time. And it happened with the individual whose son was being paid by the organization that was under investigation.",02:46,Taylor/Kent
1043,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"One other thing very quickly: if someone was a candidate for a political office, even for President of the United States, should they be immune from investigation?",03:03,Taylor/Kent
1044,Section_19,George Kent,"No one is above the law, sir.",03:16,Taylor/Kent
1045,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"Thank you. I agree with that. I think we all would agree with that. And yet I think some presume that because some of the individuals we’re talking here were candidates that they are immune from any questions or any investigation. I think it’s absurd. For heaven’s sakes, if those of us in public office, those of us who find ourselves up for reelection or all the time as a candidate, I think we have a higher standard, not immunity from asking these types of questions.",03:18,Taylor/Kent
1046,Section_19,Chris Stewart,"And last thing, then I’m going to yield my time: “Availability of funds …” I’m quoting from the NDAA in 2019. The language is specific. “Availability of funds under assistance to the Ukraine, it has to be certified.” And what has to be certified? Quote, “For the purposes of decreasing corruption.”",03:43,Taylor/Kent
1047,Section_19,Chris Stewart,Are you surprised that there would be questions about corruption in the Ukraine and that it would be discussed withholding some of this aid that’s actually required by law that it be withheld if they can’t certify that corruption has been eliminated or is being addressed?,04:03,Taylor/Kent
1048,Section_19,Speaker 3,They did certify it.,04:19,Taylor/Kent
1049,Section_19,George Kent,"The certification in that case is done by the Secretary of Defense upon advice of his staff, in consultation with the interagency community. We were fully supportive of that conditionality, and the Secretary of Defense had already certified that that conditionality had been met.",04:21,Taylor/Kent
1050,Section_19,Chris Stewart,And so we agree that we should withhold funds if there’s questions about corruption that have not been addressed.,04:35,Taylor/Kent
1051,Section_19,Chris Stewart,I’m going to yield my rest of my time to Mr. Jordan.,04:41,Taylor/Kent
1052,Section_19,Jim Jordan,"-aids held up on July 18th, is that right?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
1053,Section_20,Bill Taylor,That’s when I first heard about it.,00:02,Taylor/Kent
1054,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"Then it’s then it’s released, Ambassador Taylor on September 11th, and we know that from your deposition, in those 55 days that aid is delayed you met with president Zelensky three times. The first one was July 26th, the day after the famous call now between president Trump and President Zelensky. President Zelensky meets with you, Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Sondland and again according to your deposition and your testimony, there was no linkage of security assistance dollars to investigating Burisma or the Biden’s. Second meeting’s August 27th. Again in this 55 day timeframe. Second meeting is August 27th, President Zelensky meets with you and Ambassador Bolton and others and again, there’s no linkage of dollars, security assistant dollars to an investigation of the Bidens.",00:04,Taylor/Kent
1055,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"Then of course the third meeting is September 5th. President Zelensky meets with you and Senators Johnson and Murphy, and once again there is no linkage of security assistance dollars to an investigation of Burisma or the Bidens. Three meetings with the president of Ukraine, the new president and no linkage. That’s accurate.",00:48,Taylor/Kent
1056,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Jordan it’s certainly accurate on the first two meetings because to my knowledge, the Ukrainians were not aware of the hold on assistance until the 29th of August.",01:11,Taylor/Kent
1057,Section_20,Jim Jordan,The Politico article.,01:27,Taylor/Kent
1058,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"The Politico article. The third meeting that you mentioned with the senators, Senator Murphy and Senator Johnson, there was discussion of the security assistance, but-",01:28,Taylor/Kent
1059,Section_20,Jim Jordan,No linkage.,01:39,Taylor/Kent
1060,Section_20,Bill Taylor,There was not discussion of linkage.,01:42,Taylor/Kent
1061,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"Three meetings face to face with President Zelensky no linkage. Yet in your deposition, you said this and you said it again the first hour of the majority. “My clear understanding was security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the investigation. My clear understanding was they weren’t going to get the money until President Zelensky committed to pursue the investigations.”",01:45,Taylor/Kent
1062,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"Now, with all due respect, ambassador, your clear understanding was obviously wrong because it didn’t happen. President Zelensky didn’t announce he was going to investigate Burisma or the Bidens. He didn’t do a press conference and say, “I’m going to investigate the Bidens. We’re going to investigate Burisma. He didn’t tweet about it and you just told the ranking member he didn’t do the CNN interview and announce he’s going to investigate Burisma or the Bidens.",02:09,Taylor/Kent
1063,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"So three face to face meetings, it doesn’t come up. No linkage whatsoever. President Zelensky does it announce it before the aid is released on the 11th. And yet you said you have a clear understanding that those two things were going to happen. The money was going to get released, but not until there was an investigation, and that in fact didn’t happen. So what I’m wondering is where’d you get this clear understanding?",02:35,Taylor/Kent
1064,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"As I testified, Mr. Jordan, this came from Ambassador Sondland.",03:00,Taylor/Kent
1065,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"Can you hold one second, ambassador? I’m going to bring you a piece of paper from Ambassador Sondland’s statement. And you can take a look at this. Go ahead though. I’m going to let you finish.",03:07,Taylor/Kent
1066,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"So, Mr. Jordan, Should I read this?",03:19,Taylor/Kent
1067,Section_20,Jim Jordan,No. I just want you to have it because I’m going to read it.,03:21,Taylor/Kent
1068,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"Oh, very good. Very good.",03:23,Taylor/Kent
1069,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"But I want you to go on and finish. You said ambassador, you got this from Ambassador Sondland.",03:24,Taylor/Kent
1070,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"That is correct. That Ambassador Sondland also said that he’d talked to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak, and he told them that although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. That was one point. It was also the case-",03:28,Taylor/Kent
1071,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"Mr. Morrison talked to you, right?",03:50,Taylor/Kent
1072,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"No, what I was going to say was Ambassador Sondland also told me that he recognized that it was a mistake to have told the Ukrainians that only the meeting with the president in the oval office was held up in order to get these investigations. No, it was not just the meeting, it was also the security assistance. That is everything was. So those two discussions-",03:53,Taylor/Kent
1073,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"I understand. All right. So again, just to recap, you had three meetings with President Zelensky, no linkage in those three meetings came up. Ambassador Zelensky didn’t announce that he was going to do any investigation of the Bidens or Burisma before the aid was released. He didn’t do a tweet, didn’t do anything on CNN. Didn’t do any of that. President Zelensky, excuse me.",04:20,Taylor/Kent
1074,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"And then what you have in front of you is an addendum that Mr. Sondland made to his testimony that we got a couple of weeks ago. It says “Declaration of Ambassador Gordon Sondland, I Gordon Sondland do hereby swear and affirm as follows.” I want you to look at point number two ,bullet point number two, second sentence. “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1st, 2019 in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky.”",04:38,Taylor/Kent
1075,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"This is his clarification. Let me read it one more time. “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1st, 2019 in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky.”",05:07,Taylor/Kent
1076,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"We’ve got six people having four conversations in one sentence and you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding. Even though you had three opportunities with President Zelensky, for him to tell you, “You know what, we’re going to do these investigations to get the aid.” Didn’t tell you three different times. Never makes an announcement, never tweets about it. Never does a CNN interview. Ambassador, you weren’t on the call, were you? You didn’t listen in on President Trump’s call and President Zelensky’s call.",05:21,Taylor/Kent
1077,Section_20,Bill Taylor,I did not.,05:46,Taylor/Kent
1078,Section_20,Jim Jordan,You never talked with chief of staff Mulvaney.,05:47,Taylor/Kent
1079,Section_20,Bill Taylor,I never did.,05:49,Taylor/Kent
1080,Section_20,Jim Jordan,You never met the president.,05:49,Taylor/Kent
1081,Section_20,Bill Taylor,That’s correct.,05:51,Taylor/Kent
1082,Section_20,Jim Jordan,You had three meetings again with Zelensky that didn’t come up.,05:51,Taylor/Kent
1083,Section_20,Bill Taylor,And two of those they had never heard about it as far as I know. So there was no reason for it to come up.,05:53,Taylor/Kent
1084,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"And President Zelensky never made an announcement. This is what I can’t believe. And you’re their star witness. You’re their first witness, but you’re the guy, based on this, based on… I mean, I’ve seen church prayer change that are easier to understand than this. Ambassador Taylor recalls, and Mr. Morrison told. Now again, this is, I hereby swear and affirm from Gordon Sondland. “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1st 20 … this all happens by the way, this all happens by the way, in Warsaw when Vice President Pence meets with President Zelensky and guess what? They didn’t talk about any linkage either.",05:58,Taylor/Kent
1085,Section_20,Adam Schiff,"The time of the gentleman’s expired. Ambassador Taylor, would you like to respond?",06:38,Taylor/Kent
1086,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"The only response… I have two responses. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and Mr. Jordan. Glad to take those questions. Let me just say that I don’t consider myself a star witness for anything.",06:41,Taylor/Kent
1087,Section_20,Jim Jordan,They do.,06:53,Taylor/Kent
1088,Section_20,Bill Taylor,I don’t. I’m responding to your questions.,06:54,Taylor/Kent
1089,Section_20,Adam Schiff,Please don’t interrupt the witness.,06:58,Taylor/Kent
1090,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"As I think I was clear about, I’m not here to take one side or the other or to advocate any particular outcomes. Let me just restate that. Second thing is that my understanding is only coming from people that I talked to.",07:00,Taylor/Kent
1091,Section_20,Jim Jordan,We got that.,07:15,Taylor/Kent
1092,Section_20,Bill Taylor,"We got that, and I think this clarification from Ambassador Sondland was because he said he didn’t remember this in his first deposition. So he wanted to kind of clarify. But I think Mr. Jordan, the way I read this, he remembers it the same way I do.",07:15,Taylor/Kent
1093,Section_20,Jim Jordan,"And it’s real clear, right?",07:35,Taylor/Kent
1094,Section_20,Bill Taylor,It’s very clear to me.,07:37,Taylor/Kent
1095,Section_20,Adam Schiff,"Thank you, Ambassador Taylor.",07:38,Taylor/Kent
1096,Section_20,Jim Jordan,Turn to Mr. Jordan.,00:00,Taylor/Kent
1097,Section_21,Jim Jordan,"Mr. Ambassador, thank you. Thank you gentleman for yielding. Ambassador Taylor, the gentleman asked if you could be wrong, were you wrong when you said you had a clear understanding that President Zolinsky had to commit to an investigation of Biden’s before the aid got released and the aid got released and he didn’t commit to an investigation?",00:01,Taylor/Kent
1098,Section_21,Bill Taylor,"Mr., I was not wrong about what I told you, which is what I heard. That’s all I’ve said. I’ve told you what I heard…",00:21,Taylor/Kent
1099,Section_21,Jim Jordan,"And that’s the point. What you heard did not happen. It didn’t happen. You had three meetings with the guy. He could have told you. He didn’t announce he was going to do an investigation before the aid happen. It’s not just, could it have been wrong? The fact is it was wrong because it didn’t happen. The whole point was you had a clear understanding that aid will not get released unless there’s a commitment. Not maybe, not I think the aid might happen, and it’s my hunch is going to get released. You used clear language, clear understanding and commitment and those two things didn’t happen. So you had to be wrong.",00:27,Taylor/Kent
1100,Section_21,Bill Taylor,"Mr. Jordan, the other thing that went on when that assistance who was on hold is we shook the confidence of a close partner in our reliability and that…",01:03,Taylor/Kent
1101,Section_21,Jim Jordan,That’s not what this proceedings about Ambassador Taylor. [crosstalk 00:01:20] That’s not what this whole thing started on.,01:17,Taylor/Kent
1102,Section_21,Adam Schiff,"Time of the gentleman has expired. Ambassador Taylor, did you want to finish your answer?",01:23,Taylor/Kent
1103,Section_21,Jim Jordan,"No, that’s good, Mr. Chairman.",01:26,Taylor/Kent
1104,Section_21,Adam Schiff,I now recognize Mr. Carson for five minutes.,01:29,Taylor/Kent
1105,Section_21,Andre Carson,Thank you chairman. I yield to the chairman.,01:31,Taylor/Kent
1106,Section_21,Adam Schiff,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just want to follow up on some of the earlier questions about Ambassador, sorry about President Zolinsky’s statements after the scandal came to light. When he was asked were you pressured, how’d the phone call go, et cetera. Ukrainians, Mr. Kent, are pretty sophisticated about US politics, are they not?",01:32,Taylor/Kent
1107,Section_21,George Kent,Perhaps.,01:54,Taylor/Kent
1108,Section_21,Adam Schiff,"You would agree that if President Zolinsky contradicted President Trump and said, “Of course I felt pressured. They were holding up 400 million in military assistance. We have people dying every day.” If he were to contradict President Trump directly, they would be sophisticated enough to know they may pay a very heavy price with this president, were they not?",01:56,Taylor/Kent
1109,Section_21,George Kent,That’s a fair assessment.,02:18,Taylor/Kent
1110,Section_21,Adam Schiff,"And President Zolinsky not only had to worry about retribution from Donald Trump, should he contradict Donald Trump publicly, he also has to worry about how he’s perceived domestically, doesn’t he, ambassador Taylor?",02:20,Taylor/Kent
1111,Section_21,Bill Taylor,"President Zolinsky’s very sensitive to the views of Ukrainian people, who indeed are very attentive to Ukrainian, US politics. Yes.",02:33,Taylor/Kent
1112,Section_21,Adam Schiff,"And so if President Zolinsky were to say, “I had to capitulate and agree to these investigations, I was ready to go on CNN until the aid got restored.” That would obviously be hurtful to him back home, would it not?",02:44,Taylor/Kent
1113,Section_21,Bill Taylor,He cannot afford to be seen to be deferring to any foreign leader. He is very confident in his own abilities and he knows that the Ukrainian people expect him to be clear and defend Ukrainian interests.,03:03,Taylor/Kent
1114,Section_21,Rep. Will Hurd,"Gentlemen, I appreciate you all’s decade of service as the fabled foreign service officer, Ambassador Ryan Crocker says, because we have pumps and wingtips on the ground, meaning diplomats that prevents us from having the need to have boots on the ground, the military. You all are an important role in our national security and thank you and your colleagues. Mr. Taylor, my first questions are to you, and these are questions that are on years prior to your time in the Ukraine, but I’m pretty sure you can answer them. Did the Ukrainians get aid in FY ’17?",00:00,Taylor/Kent
1115,Section_22,Bill Taylor,Did they get any aid in FY ’17?,00:38,Taylor/Kent
1116,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,Yeah.,00:41,Taylor/Kent
1117,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir. They did get assistance.",00:41,Taylor/Kent
1118,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,And they got security assistance as well?,00:43,Taylor/Kent
1119,Section_22,Bill Taylor,They did.,00:45,Taylor/Kent
1120,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,"And if I said that number was circa, in military assistance around 270 million, would that probably be accurate?",00:46,Taylor/Kent
1121,Section_22,Bill Taylor,Close.,00:54,Taylor/Kent
1122,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,About right?,00:55,Taylor/Kent
1123,Section_22,Bill Taylor,Yeah.,00:55,Taylor/Kent
1124,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,Did they get aid in FY ’18?,00:56,Taylor/Kent
1125,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",01:00,Taylor/Kent
1126,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,Including security assistance?,01:01,Taylor/Kent
1127,Section_22,Bill Taylor,Including security assistance.,01:01,Taylor/Kent
1128,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,"We’ve already talked about the javelins, the anti-tank missiles that they were not able to purchase in previous administrations. Have they gotten security assistance in FY ’19?",01:04,Taylor/Kent
1129,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",01:15,Taylor/Kent
1130,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,Prior to the 400 million or so that we’re discussing or been discussing a lot here today?,01:16,Taylor/Kent
1131,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"They got some previous year some, probably FY ’18 assistance, but George, you may know.",01:23,Taylor/Kent
1132,Section_22,George Kent,"It takes a while once money is obligated to actually reach the country. There were two island-class ships that just arrived in the Port of Odessa and that was with prior year money, so there’s about a lag of a year.",01:30,Taylor/Kent
1133,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,My point is that we have been supporting the Ukrainians under this administration in order to help them kick out the Russians who invaded their country.,01:42,Taylor/Kent
1134,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",01:52,Taylor/Kent
1135,Section_22,George Kent,100%.,01:53,Taylor/Kent
1136,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,"Ambassador Taylor, you are testifying that Ukrainian officials did not become aware of potential US assistance being withheld until August 29th, is that accurate?",01:54,Taylor/Kent
1137,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"That’s my understanding, Mr. Hurd.",02:04,Taylor/Kent
1138,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,Would you find it surprising if a Ukrainian official knew about that sooner and did not contact you?,02:06,Taylor/Kent
1139,Section_22,Bill Taylor,I can answer that it was only after August 29th when the political argument that I got calls from several of the Ukrainian officials.,02:17,Taylor/Kent
1140,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,"Good copy. Mr. Kent, had you had any Ukrainian official contacting you concerned about … When was the first time a Ukrainian official contacted you concerned about potential withholding of USAID?",02:29,Taylor/Kent
1141,Section_22,George Kent,It was after the article in Politico came out in that first intense week of September.,02:42,Taylor/Kent
1142,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,"Got you, so after that August 29th conversation. There’s a lot of talk about Rudy Giuliani and who he was and wasn’t meeting. Do we know or have an idea of the Ukrainian officials that he was meeting with over the last couple of years?",02:47,Taylor/Kent
1143,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"I don’t, sir.",03:08,Taylor/Kent
1144,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,Have you had any Ukrainian officials call you after a meeting with Rudy Giuliani concerned about the nature of the context of that conversation?,03:10,Taylor/Kent
1145,Section_22,Bill Taylor,Yes. Mr. Yermak has expressed concern about his interactions with Mr. Giuliani.,03:23,Taylor/Kent
1146,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,"And I believe that meeting was somewhere in late August, is that correct?",03:29,Taylor/Kent
1147,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"It was. There were meetings and there were, I think, also phone calls.",03:33,Taylor/Kent
1148,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,And you all have talked many times that you all are still concerned about corruption and Ukraine. Is that correct?,03:43,Taylor/Kent
1149,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",03:47,Taylor/Kent
1150,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,Have we seen whatever this anti-corruption statement we wanted the Ukrainians to make?,03:48,Taylor/Kent
1151,Section_22,George Kent,"Are you referring to the statement that was being negotiated between Kurt Volker, Gordon Sondland and Andrey Yermak?",03:59,Taylor/Kent
1152,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,Yes.,04:04,Taylor/Kent
1153,Section_22,George Kent,"That was not an anti-corruption statement, sir.",04:05,Taylor/Kent
1154,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,What was the statement?,04:07,Taylor/Kent
1155,Section_22,George Kent,"I think if you go back to the back and forth, the WhatsApps that were shared by Kurt Volker, they shared a draft with Rudy Giuliani and Rudy Giuliani said it would not be acceptable if it didn’t mention Biden, Burisma in 2016.",04:09,Taylor/Kent
1156,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,But that statement was never agreed to or was never issued by the Ukrainian officials. Is that correct?,04:23,Taylor/Kent
1157,Section_22,George Kent,"No statement of that sort was issued, correct.",04:29,Taylor/Kent
1158,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,And have US businesses ever contacted you all concerned about corruption within Ukraine?,04:32,Taylor/Kent
1159,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",04:39,Taylor/Kent
1160,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,"As of this year, even?",04:41,Taylor/Kent
1161,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"Yes, sir.",04:43,Taylor/Kent
1162,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,"Because the concern is not just how Ukrainian businesses run by oligarchs are being operated, it’s also concerns about how the Ukrainian government is dealing with American businesses trying to operate in Ukraine. Is that accurate?",04:43,Taylor/Kent
1163,Section_22,Bill Taylor,"American businesses are very concerned about the judicial system in particular. Yes, sir.",04:58,Taylor/Kent
1164,Section_22,Rep. Will Hurd,"I yield back in time I do not have, Mr. Chairman.",05:02,Taylor/Kent
1165,Section_22,Speaker 1,"Mister … Sorry, representative Stefanik, you’re recognized.",00:01,Taylor/Kent
1166,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"Thank you. For the millions of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following. Number one, Ukraine received the aid. Number two, there was, in fact, no investigation into Biden.",00:05,Taylor/Kent
1167,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"Mr. Kent and Ambassador Taylor, you both spoke eloquently and passionately about the need to support Ukraine to counter Russian aggression, particularly during this very critical time. I agree with you in that assessment. And isn’t it the case that the Trump administration has, indeed, provided substantial aid to Ukraine in the form of defensive lethal aid? Correct?",00:18,Taylor/Kent
1168,Section_22,Speaker 3,That is correct.,00:39,Taylor/Kent
1169,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"And that is more so than the Obama administration, correct?",00:40,Taylor/Kent
1170,Section_22,Speaker 3,The Trump administration-,00:44,Taylor/Kent
1171,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,Defensive lethal aid.,00:45,Taylor/Kent
1172,Section_22,Speaker 3,Yes.,00:48,Taylor/Kent
1173,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"And in the transcript of the President’s July 25th call with President Zelensky, President Zelensky tells Trump they are ready to buy more javelins. This is, indeed, the most effective weapon for fighting insurgent armor Russian tanks. Is that correct?",00:48,Taylor/Kent
1174,Section_22,Speaker 3,That is correct.,01:02,Taylor/Kent
1175,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,And those javelins were not made available to Ukraine under the Obama administration.,01:03,Taylor/Kent
1176,Section_22,Speaker 3,So-,01:07,Taylor/Kent
1177,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,The javelins were not made available-,01:09,Taylor/Kent
1178,Section_22,Speaker 3,They were not.,01:11,Taylor/Kent
1179,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"Correct. Shifting gears to corruption, one of the themes here today is that of rooting out corruption, which is an important tool for the president as we provide taxpayer-funded aid to foreign countries. Mr. Kent, you would characterize Ukraine as having longstanding corruption issues, correct?",01:11,Taylor/Kent
1180,Section_22,George Kent,I did.,01:31,Taylor/Kent
1181,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"And in fact, you testified. “I would say that corruption is part of the reason why Ukrainians came out to the streets, in both 2004 when somebody tried to steal the election and again in 2014 because of a corrupt kleptocratic pro-Russian government which eventually collapsed. The Ukrainians decided enough was enough.” Is that your testimony?",01:32,Taylor/Kent
1182,Section_22,George Kent,It remains so.,01:52,Taylor/Kent
1183,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"And you testified that you first came to learn about Burisma in 2015 when you were the senior anti-corruption coordinator, correct?",01:53,Taylor/Kent
1184,Section_22,George Kent,Correct. Detailed to the embassy in Kiev as the acting deputy chief of mission.,02:01,Taylor/Kent
1185,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"And you testified that the issue of corruption in Burisma was in the US interest because, and this is from your deposition, “We had made a commitment to the Ukrainian government in 2014 to try to recover an estimated tens of billions of dollars of stolen assets out of the country.” Is that correct?",02:07,Taylor/Kent
1186,Section_22,George Kent,"That is stolen assets that were in the name of the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky. He was the one who we believed had stolen the money.",02:26,Taylor/Kent
1187,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"Sure. So the first case, this was … the first case that the US, the UK, and Ukraine investigator worked on was against the owner of Burisma.",02:34,Taylor/Kent
1188,Section_22,George Kent,That’s correct.,02:44,Taylor/Kent
1189,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,And this was during the Obama administration.,02:45,Taylor/Kent
1190,Section_22,George Kent,That’s correct.,02:48,Taylor/Kent
1191,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"So for the millions of Americans viewing, the first investigation against the owner of Burisma was under President Obama’s administration.",02:48,Taylor/Kent
1192,Section_22,George Kent,That’s correct.,02:57,Taylor/Kent
1193,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"You testified also, “We spent roughly half a million dollars of State Department money in support of the FBI and this investigation, to build capacity and track down stolen assets.” Is that correct?",02:58,Taylor/Kent
1194,Section_22,George Kent,"That’s correct. It was launched in May 2014 by the Attorney General of the US and UK, in conjunction with the World Bank.",03:09,Taylor/Kent
1195,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"And in fact, by 2016, you were so concerned about corruption questions related to Burisma that when there was an effort by Burisma to sponsor an essay contest with USAID, you asked USAID to stop it.",03:16,Taylor/Kent
1196,Section_22,George Kent,That’s correct.,03:31,Taylor/Kent
1197,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"And you testified that it was because “Burisma had a poor reputation in the business,” and that you didn’t think it was appropriate for the US government to be co-sponsoring something with a company that had a bad reputation. Correct?",03:32,Taylor/Kent
1198,Section_22,George Kent,Correct.,03:45,Taylor/Kent
1199,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"You are also aware, and you testified today, that Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma.",03:46,Taylor/Kent
1200,Section_22,George Kent,Correct.,03:52,Taylor/Kent
1201,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,And you also testified that you were indeed concerned about the appearance of conflict of interest.,03:53,Taylor/Kent
1202,Section_22,George Kent,That’s correct.,03:57,Taylor/Kent
1203,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"And broadly, this is very important, you testified in your deposition that when the State Department evaluates for an assistance, it is appropriate for them to look at levels of corruption in countries.",03:59,Taylor/Kent
1204,Section_22,George Kent,That’s correct.,04:11,Taylor/Kent
1205,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,"And lastly, you also testified that, and this is your quote, “Issues of corruption have been part of high-level dialogue between US leaders and Ukrainian leaders, regardless of who is the US leader and who is the Ukrainian leader. And that is a normal issue of diplomatic discussion at the highest level.” Is that correct?",04:11,Taylor/Kent
1206,Section_22,George Kent,That’s correct.,04:30,Taylor/Kent
1207,Section_22,Rep. Stefanik,I will yield 30 seconds. You know what? I will yield back after that. Thank you.,04:31,Taylor/Kent
0,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Order. Good morning, everyone. This is the second in a series of public hearings the committee will be holding as part of the House’s impeachment inquiry. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recess of the committee at any time. There is a quorum present. We will proceed today in the same fashion as our first hearing. I’ll make an opening statement, and then Ranking Member, Nunes, will have the opportunity to make a statement. Then we will turn to our witness for an opening statement and then to questions. For audience members, we welcome you and respect your interest in being here. In turn, we ask for your respect as we proceed with today’s hearing.",00:00,Yovanovitch
1,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"It is the intention of the committee to proceed without disruptions. As chairman, I will take all necessary and appropriate steps to maintain order and to ensure that the committee is run in accordance with House rules and House Resolution 660. With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.",00:36,Yovanovitch
2,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In April 2019, the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was in Kiev when she was called by a senior State Department official and told to get on the next plane back to Washington. Upon her return to DC, she was informed by her superiors that although she had done nothing wrong, she could no longer serve as ambassador to Ukraine because she did not have the confidence of the president. It was a stunning turn of events for this highly-regarded career diplomat who had done such a remarkable job fighting corruption in Ukraine that a short time earlier she had been asked by the State Department to extend her tour. Ambassador Yovanovitch has been in the Foreign Service for 33 years and served much of that time in the former Soviet Union.",00:56,Yovanovitch
3,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Her parents had fled Stalin and later Hitler, before settling in the United States. She is an exemplary officer who is widely praised and respected by her colleagues. She is known as an anti-corruption champion whose tour in Kiev was viewed as very successful. Ambassador Michael McKinley who had served with her in the Foreign Service for several decades stated that from the earliest days of her career in the Foreign Service she was excellent, serious, committed. I certainly remember her being one of those people who seemed to be destined for greater things. Her successor who is acting chief of mission in Ukraine, Ambassador Bill Taylor, described her as very frank. She was very direct. She made points very clearly and she was indeed tough on corruption. And she named names. And that sometimes is controversial out there, but she’s a strong person and made those charges.",01:47,Yovanovitch
4,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In her time in Kiev, Ambassador Yovanovitch was tough on corruption, too tough on corruption for some, and her principled stance made her enemies. As George Kent told this committee on Wednesday, you can’t promote principled anti-corruption action without pissing off corrupt people. And Ambassador Yovanovitch did not just piss off corrupt Ukrainians like the corrupt former Prosecutor General, Yuriy Lutsenko, but also certain Americans, like Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump’s personal attorney, and two individuals now indicted who worked with him, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas.",02:47,Yovanovitch
5,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Lutsenko, Giuliani, Fruman, Parnas and others who had come to include the president’s own son, Don Jr., promoted a smear campaign against her based on false allegations. At the State Department there was an effort to push back to obtain a statement of support from Secretary Pompeo, but those efforts failed when it became clear that President Trump wanted her gone. Some have argued that a president has the ability to nominate or remove any ambassador he wants, that they serve at the pleasure of the president, and that is true. The question before us is not whether Donald Trump could recall an American ambassador with a stellar reputation for fighting corruption in Ukraine, but why would he want to? Why did Rudy Giuliani want her gone, and why did Donald Trump?",03:28,Yovanovitch
6,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And why would Donald Trump instruct the new team he put in place, the three amigos, Gordon Sondland, Rick Perry and Kurt Volker, to work with the same man, Rudy Giuliani, who played such a central role in the smear campaign against her? Rudy Giuliani has made no secret of his desire to get Ukraine to open investigations into the Bidens, as well as a conspiracy theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. As he said in one interview in May 2019, we’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do. More recently, he told CNN’s Chris Cuomo, “Of course I did,” when asked if he had pressed Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. And he has never been shy about who he is doing this work for, his client, the president.",04:21,Yovanovitch
7,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"One powerful ally Giuliani had in Ukraine to promote these political investigations was Lutsenko, the corrupt former Prosecutor General. And one powerful adversary Lutsenko had was a certain United States ambassador named Marie Yovanovitch. It is no coincidence that in the now infamous July 25th call with Zelensky, Donald Trump brings up a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor and praises him. Against all evidence, Trump claims that this former Prosecutor General was very good, and he was shut down, and that’s really unfair. But the woman known for fighting corruption, his own former ambassador, the woman ruthlessly smeared and driven from her post, the president does nothing but disparage, or worse, threaten.",05:15,Yovanovitch
8,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Well, she’s going to go through some things, the president declares. That tells you a lot about the president’s priorities and intentions. Getting rid of Ambassador Yovanovitch helped to set the stage for an irregular channel that could pursue the two investigations that mattered so much to the president, the 2016 conspiracy theory, and most important, an investigation into the 2020 political opponent he apparently feared most, Joe Biden. And the president’s scheme might have worked but for the fact that the man who would succeed Ambassador Yovanovitch, whom we heard from on Wednesday, Acting Ambassador Taylor, would eventually discover the effort to press Ukraine into conducting these investigations and would push back, but for the fact also that someone blew the whistle.",06:09,Yovanovitch
9,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador Yovanovitch was serving our nation’s interest in fighting corruption in Ukraine, but she was considered an obstacle to the furtherance of the president’s personal and political agenda. For that, she was smeared and cast aside. The powers of the presidency are immense, but they are not absolute. And they cannot be used for corrupt purpose. The American people expect their president to use the authority they grant him in the service of the nation, not to destroy others to advance his personal or political interests. I now recognize Ranking Member Nunes for his remarks.",07:00,Yovanovitch
10,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"I thank the gentleman. It’s unfortunate that today and for most of next week we will continue engaging in the Democrats daylong TV spectacles instead of solving the problems we were all sent to Washington to address. We now have a major trade agreement with Canada and Mexico ready for approval, a deal that would create jobs and boost our economy. Meanwhile, we have not yet approved funding for the government which expires next week along with funding for our men and women in uniform. Instead the Democrats have convened us once again to advance their operation to topple a duly elected president. I will note that five, five, Democrats on this committee had already voted to impeach this President before the Trump-Zelensky phone call occurred.",07:46,Yovanovitch
11,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"In fact, Democrats have been vowing to oust President Trump since the day he was elected. So Americans can rightly suspect that his phone call with President Zelensky was used as an excuse for the Democrats to fulfill their Watergate fantasies. But I’m glad that on Wednesday after the Democrats staged six weeks of secret depositions in the basement of the capital like some kind of strange cult, the American people finally got to see this farce for themselves. They saw us sit through hours of hearsay testimony about conversations that two diplomats who had never spoken to the president heard second hand, third hand and forth hand from other people. In other words rumors. The problem of trying to overthrow a president based on this type of evidence is obvious, but that’s what their whole case relies on beginning with second hand and third hand information cited by the whistleblower.",08:44,Yovanovitch
12,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"That’s why on Wednesday the Democrats were forced to make the absurd argument that hearsay can be much better evidence than direct evidence. And just when you thought the spectacle couldn’t get more bizarre, committee Republicans received a memo from the Democrats threatening ethics referrals if we out the whistleblower. As the Democrats are well aware, no Republicans here know the whistleblower’s identity because the whistleblower only met with Democrats, not with Republicans. The chairmanship claimed not to know who it is yet he also vowed to block us from asking questions that could reveal his or her identity. Republicans on this committee are left wondering how it is even possible for the chairman to block questions about a person whose identity he claims not to know.",09:51,Yovanovitch
13,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"The American people may be seeing these absurdities for the first time but Republicans on this dais are used to them. Until they secretly met with a whistleblower, Democrats showed little interest for the last three years in any topic aside from the ridiculous conspiracy theories that President Trump is a Russian agent. When you find yourself on the phone like the Democrats did with the Russian pranksters offering you nude pictures of Trump and afterward you order your staff to follow up and get the photos as the Democrats also did, then it might be time to ask yourself if you have gone out too far on a limb. Even as they were accusing Republicans of colluding with Russians, the Democrats themselves were colluding with the Russians by funding the Steele dossier which was based on Russian and Ukrainian sources.",10:50,Yovanovitch
14,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Meanwhile, they turn a blind eye to Ukrainians meddling in our elections because the Democrats were cooperating with that operation. This was the subject of a July 20th, 2017 letter, sent by Senator Grassley to then Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. The letter raised concerns about the activities of Alexandra Chalupa, a contractor for the Democratic National Committee who worked with Ukrainian Embassy officials to spread dirt on the Trump campaign.",11:45,Yovanovitch
15,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"As Senator Grassley wrote, Chalupa’s action… “Chalupa’s actions appear to show that she was simultaneously working on behalf of a foreign government, Ukraine, and on behalf of the DNC and the Clinton campaign in an effort to influence not only the US voting population, but US government officials”. After touting the Steele dossier and defending the FBI’s Russia investigation which are now being investigated by Inspector General Horowitz and Attorney General Barr, Democrats on this committee ignore Ukrainian election meddling even though Chalupa publicly admitted to the Democrats scheme.",12:20,Yovanovitch
16,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Likewise, they are blind to the blaring signs of corruption surrounding Hunter Biden’s well-paid position on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian company while his father served as vice president and point man for Ukraine issues in the Obama administration. But the Democrats media hacks only cared about that issue briefly when they were trying to stop Joe Biden from running against Hillary Clinton in 2015. As I previously stated, these hearings should not be occurring at all until we get the answers to three crucial questions the Democrats refused to ask.",13:03,Yovanovitch
17,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"First, what is the full extent of the Democrats prior coordination with the whistleblower and who else did the whistleblower coordinate this effort with? Second, what is the full extent of Ukraine’s election meddling against the Trump campaign? And third, why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden, what did he do for them and did his position affect any government actions under the Obama administration? I will note that house Democrats vowed they would not put the American people through a wrenching impeachment process without bipartisan support and they have none. Add that to their ever-growing list of broken promises and destructive deceptions.",13:43,Yovanovitch
18,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"In closing, Mr. Chair, the president of the United States released his transcript right before the hearing began. I think it is important that I read this into the record so that there is no confusion over this first phone call that occurred on April 21st, with president-elect, Zelensky, and I would like to read it. The president, I would like to congratulate you on a job well done and congratulations on a fantastic election. Zelensky, good to hear from you. Thank you so very much. It is nice to hear from you and I appreciate the congratulations. The president, that was an incredible election. Zelensky, again, thank you so very much. As you can see, we tried very hard to do our best. We had you as a great example. The president, I think you will do a great job.",14:30,Yovanovitch
19,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"I have many friends in Ukraine who know you and like you. I have many friends from Ukraine and frankly, expected you to win and it’s really an amazing thing that you have done. I guess in a way I did something similar. We are making tremendous progress in the US. We have the most tremendous economy ever. I just wanted to congratulate you. I have no doubt you will be a fantastic president. Zelensky, first of all, thank you so very much again, for the congratulations. We in the Ukraine are an independent country, an independent Ukraine. We are going to do everything for the people. You are, as I said, a great example. We are hoping we can expand on our jobs as you did. You will also be a great example for many. You are a great example for our new managers. I would also like to invite you if possible, to the inauguration. I know how busy you are but if it’s possible for you to come to the inauguration ceremony, that would be great.",15:27,Yovanovitch
20,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Great for you to do to be with us on that day. The president, that’s very nice. I will look into that and give us a date. At the very minimum we will have a great representative or more from the United States will be with you on that great day. So we will have somebody at a minimum a very, very high level and will be with you. Really an incredible day for an incredible achievement. Zelensky, again, thank you. We are looking forward to your visit to the visit of a high-level delegation, but there is no words that can describe our wonderful country, how nice, warm and friendly our people are, how tasty and delicious our food is and how wonderful Ukraine is. Words cannot describe our country so it would be best for you to see it yourself. So if you can come, that would be great. So again, I invite you to come.",16:28,Yovanovitch
21,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"The president, well, I agree with you about your country and I look forward to it. When I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people. Ukraine always very well represented. It was always very well represented. When you are settled in and ready, I would like to invite you to the White House. We will have a lot of things to talk about but we are with you all of the way. Zelensky, thank you for the invitation. We accept the invitation and look forward to the visit. Thank you again. The whole team and I are looking forward to the visit. Thank you for the congratulations and I think it will still be great if you can come and be with us on this important day. The results are incredible. They are very impressive for us. So it will be absolutely fantastic if you could come on that day.",17:18,Yovanovitch
22,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"The president, very good. We will let you know very soon and we will see you very, very soon regardless. Congratulations and please say hello to the Ukrainian people and your family. Let them know I send my best regards. Well, thank you… Zelensky, well, thank you. You have a safe flight and see you soon. President, take care of yourself and give a great speech today. You take care of yourself and I will see you soon. Zelensky, thank you very much. It is difficult for me but I will practice English and I will meet in English. Thank you very much. The president laughing, all that’s beautiful to hear. That’s really good. I could not do it in your language. I’m very impressed. Thank you so much. Zelensky, thank you so much. The president, good day, good luck. I’m glad I was able to read that into the record so that now the American people know the very first call that President Trump had with President Zelensky. And with that, I yield back the balance of my time.",18:04,Yovanovitch

Ambassador Yovanovitch immigrated to Connecticut at three, became a naturalized American at 18, and entered the US Foreign Service in 1986. She has served as US ambassador three times and been nominated by presidents of both parties. George W. Bush nominated her to be ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic where she served from 2005 to 2008. President Obama then nominated her to be US ambassador to Armenia where she served from 2008 until 2011 and US ambassador to Ukraine where she served from 2016 until she was recalled to Washington by President Trump this May.",21:12,Yovanovitch
59,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Beyond these ambassadorial posts, she has held numerous other senior positions at the State Department including in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. She served as a dean at the Foreign Service Institute and taught National Security Strategy at the Defense University. She also previously served at US embassies in Kiev, Ottawa, Moscow, London and Mogadishu. Ambassador Yovanovitch has received multiple honors from the department for her diplomatic work, including the Presidential Distinguished Service Award and the Secretary’s Diplomacy in Human Rights Award. Two final points before our witness is sworn. First, witness deposition as part of this inquiry were unclassified in nature and all open hearings will also be held at the unclassified level. Any information that may touch on classified information will be addressed separately.

Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you’re about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Let the record show that the witness has answered in the affirmative. Thank you and please be seated. Without objection, your written statement will be made part of the record.

62,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And ambassador, you’ll need to speak very close to the microphone.",23:37,Yovanovitch
63,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Thank you for the opportunity to start with this statement. To reintroduce myself to the committee and to highlight parts of my biography and experience, I come before you as an American citizen who has devoted the majority of my life, 33 years, to service to the country that all of us love. Like my colleagues, I entered the foreign service understanding that my job was to implement the foreign policy interests of this nation as defined by the president and Congress and to do so regardless of which person or party was in power. I had no agenda other than to pursue our stated foreign policy goals. My service is an expression of gratitude for all that this country has given to me and to my family. My late parents did not have the good fortune to come of age in a free society.",23:41,Yovanovitch
64,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"My father fled the Soviets before ultimately finding refuge in the United States. My mother’s family escaped the USSR after the Bolshevik Revolution and she grew up stateless in Nazi Germany before also eventually making her way to the United States. Their personal histories, my personal history, gave me both deep gratitude towards the United States and great empathy for others like the Ukrainian people who want to be free. I joined the foreign service during the Reagan administration and subsequently served three other Republican presidents as well as two Democratic presidents. It was my great honor to be appointed to serve as an ambassador three times, twice by George W. Bush, and once by Barack Obama.",24:42,Yovanovitch
65,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"There is a perception that diplomats lead a comfortable life throwing dinner parties in fancy homes. Let me tell you about some of my reality. It has not always been easy. I have moved 13 times and served in seven different countries, five of them hardship posts. My first tour was Mogadishu, Somalia, an increasingly dangerous place as that country’s civil war kept grinding on and the government was weakening. The military took over policing functions in a particularly brutal way and basic services disappeared. Several years later after the Soviet Union collapsed, I helped open our embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. As we were establishing relations with a new country, our small embassy was attacked by a gunman who sprayed the embassy building with gunfire.",25:34,Yovanovitch
66,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I later served in Moscow. In 1993 during the attempted coup in Moscow in Russia, I was caught in crossfire between presidential and parliamentary forces. It took us three tries, me without a helmet or body armor to get into a vehicle to go to the embassy. We went because the ambassador asked us to come and we went because it was our duty. From August 2016 until May 2019, I served as the US ambassador to Ukraine. During my tenure in Ukraine, I went to the front line approximately 10 times during a hot war to show the American flag, to hear what was going on, sometimes literally as we heard the impact of artillery, and to see how our assistance dollars were being put to use.",26:32,Yovanovitch
67,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I worked to advance US policy, fully embraced by Democrats and Republicans alike, to help Ukraine become a stable and independent democratic state with a market economy integrated into Europe. A secure democratic and free Ukraine serves not just the Ukrainian people, but the American people as well. That’s why it was our policy, continues to be our policy, to help the Ukrainians achieve their objectives. They match our objectives. The US is the most powerful country in the history of the world in large part because of our values and our values have made possible the network of alliances and partnerships that buttresses our own strength. Ukraine with an enormous landmass and a large population, has the potential to be a significant commercial and political partner for the United States as well as a force multiplier on the security side.",27:24,Yovanovitch
68,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"We see the potential in Ukraine. Russia sees, by contrast, sees the risk. The history is not written yet, but Ukraine could move at out of Russia’s orbit. And now, Ukraine is a battleground for great power competition with a hot war for the control of territory and a hybrid war to control Ukraine’s leadership. The US has provided significant security assistance since the onset of the war against Russia in 2014, and the Trump administration strengthened our policy by approving the provision to Ukraine of anti-tank missiles, known as Javelins. Supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do. It’s also the smart thing to do. If Russia prevails and Ukraine falls to Russian dominion, we can expect to see other attempts by Russia to expand its territory and its influence.",28:27,Yovanovitch
69,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"As critical as the war against Russia is, Ukraine’s struggling democracy has an equally important challenge, battling the Soviet legacy of corruption which has pervaded Ukraine’s government. Corruption makes Ukraine’s leaders ever vulnerable to Russia, and the Ukrainian people understand that. That’s why they launched the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, demanding to be a part of Europe, demanding the transformation of the system, demanding to live under the rule of law. Ukrainians wanted the law to apply equally to all people, whether the individual in question is the president or any other citizen. It was a question of fairness, of dignity. Here again, there is a coincidence of interest. Corrupt leaders are inherently less trustworthy, while an honest and accountable Ukrainian leadership makes a US-Ukrainian partnership more reliable and more valuable to the United States.",29:27,Yovanovitch
70,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"A level playing field, in this strategically located country bordering for NATO allies, creates an environment in which US business can more easily trade, invest and profit. Corruption is also a security issue, because corrupt officials are vulnerable to Moscow. In short, it is in America’s national security interest to help Ukraine transform into a country where the rule of law governs and corruption is held in check. It was and remains a top US priority to help Ukraine fight corruption, and significant progress has been made since the 2014 Revolution of Dignity. Unfortunately, as the past couple of months have underlined, not all Ukrainians embraced our anti-corruption work. Thus, perhaps it was not surprising that when our anti-corruption efforts got in the way of a desire for profit or power, Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old corrupt rules sought to remove me. What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of the US ambassador.",30:26,Yovanovitch
71,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"How could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government? Which country’s interests are served when the very corrupt behavior we have been criticizing is allowed to prevail? Such conduct undermines the US, exposes our friends, and widens the playing field for autocrats like President Putin. Our leadership depends on the power of our example and the consistency of our purpose. Both have now been opened to question. With that background in mind, I’d like to briefly address some of the factual issues I expect you may want to ask me about, starting with my timeline in Ukraine and the events about which I do and do not have firsthand knowledge.",31:42,Yovanovitch
72,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I arrived in Ukraine on August 22nd, 2016, and left Ukraine permanently on May 20th, 2019. There are a number of events you are investigating to which I cannot bring any firsthand knowledge. The events that predated my Ukraine service include the release of the so-called black ledger and Mr. Manafort’s subsequent resignation from President Trump’s campaign, and the departure from office of former Prosecutor General, Viktor Shokin. Several other events occurred after I returned from Ukraine. These include President Trump’s July 25th, 2019 call with President Zelensky, the discussions surrounding that phone call, and any discussions surrounding the delay of security assistance to Ukraine in the summer of 2019.",32:35,Yovanovitch
73,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"As for events during my tenure in Ukraine, I want to reiterate first that the allegation that I disseminated a do not prosecute list was a fabrication. Mr. Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General who made that allegation, has acknowledged that the list never existed. I did not tell Mr. Lutsenko or other Ukrainian officials who they should or should not prosecute. Instead, I advocated the US position that rule of law should prevail, and Ukrainian law enforcement prosecutors and judges should stop wielding their power selectively as a political weapon against their adversaries and start dealing with all consistently and according to the law.",33:27,Yovanovitch
74,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Also untrue are unsourced allegations that I told unidentified embassy employees or Ukrainian officials that President’s Trump’s orders should be ignored because he was going to be impeached or for any other reason. I did not and I would not say such a thing. Such statements would be inconsistent with my training as a foreign service officer and my role as an ambassador. The Obama administration did not ask me to help the Clinton campaign or harm the Trump campaign, nor would I have taken any such steps if they had. Partisanship of this type is not compatible with the role of a career of foreign service officer. I have never met Hunter Biden, nor have I had any direct or indirect conversations with him.",34:16,Yovanovitch
75,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"And although I have met former Vice President, Biden, several times over the course of our many years in government service, neither he nor the previous administration ever raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden with me. With respect to Mayor Giuliani, I have had only minimal contact with him, a total of three, none related to the events at issue. I do not understand Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me, nor can I offer an opinion on whether he believe the allegations he spread about me. Clearly, no one at the State Department did. What I can say is that Mr. Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.",35:08,Yovanovitch
76,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"After being asked by the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs in early March 2019 to extend my tour until 2020, the smear campaign against me entered a new public phase in the United States. In the wake of the negative press, State Department officials suggested an earlier departure, and we agreed upon July 2019. I was then abruptly told, just weeks later in late April, to come back to Washington from Ukraine on the next plane. At the time I departed, Ukraine had just concluded game changing presidential elections. It was a sensitive period, with much at stake for the United States and called for all the experience and expertise we could muster. When I returned to the United States, Deputy Secretary of State, Sullivan, told me there had been a concerted campaign against me, that the president no longer wished me to serve as ambassador to Ukraine, and that in fact, the president had been pushing for my removal since the prior summer.",36:05,Yovanovitch
77,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"As Mr. Sullivan recently recounted during his Senate confirmation hearing, neither he nor anyone else ever explained or sought to justify the president’s concerns about me, nor did anyone in the department justify my early departure by suggesting I had done something wrong. I appreciate that Mr. Sullivan publicly affirmed at his hearing that I had served capably and admirably. Although then and now I have always understood that I served at the pleasure of the president, I still find it difficult to comprehend that foreign and private interests were able to undermine US interests in this way. Individuals who apparently felt stymied by our efforts to promote stated US policy against corruption, that is to do our mission, were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador using unofficial back channels.",37:10,Yovanovitch
78,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"As various witnesses have recounted, they shared baseless allegations with the president and convinced him to remove his ambassador, despite the fact that the State Department fully understood that the allegations were false and the sources highly suspect. These events should concern everyone in this room. Ambassadors are the symbol of the United States abroad. They are the personal representative of the president. They should always act and speak with full authority to advocate for US policies. If our chief representative is kneecapped, it limits our effectiveness to safeguard the vital national security interests of the United States.",38:07,Yovanovitch
79,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"This is especially important now when the international landscape is more complicated and more competitive than it has been since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Our Ukraine policy has been thrown into disarray, and shady interests the world over have learned how little it takes to remove an American ambassador who does not give them what they want. After these events, what foreign official, corrupt or not, could be blamed for wondering whether the US ambassador represents the president’s views? And what US ambassador could be blamed for harboring the fear they can’t count on our government to support them as they implement stated US policy and protect and defend US interests?",38:48,Yovanovitch
80,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I’d like to comment on one other matter before taking your questions. At the closed deposition, I expressed grave concerns about the degradation of the Foreign Service over the past few years and the failure of State Department leadership to push back as foreign and corrupt interests apparently hijacked our Ukraine policy. I remain disappointed that the Department’s leadership and others have declined to acknowledge that the attacks against me and others are dangerously wrong. This is about far, far more than me or a couple of individuals. As Foreign Service professionals are being denigrated and undermined, the institution is also being degraded.",39:39,Yovanovitch
81,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"This will soon cause real harm if it hasn’t already. The State Department as a tool of foreign policy often doesn’t get the same kind of attention or even respect as the military might of the Pentagon, but we are, as they say, the pointy end of the spear. If we lose our edge, the US will inevitably have to use other tools even more than it does today, and those other tools are blunter, more expensive and not universally effective. Moreover, attacks are leading to a crisis in the State Department as the policy process is visibly unraveling. Leadership vacancies go unfilled, and senior and mid-level officers ponder an uncertain future. The crisis has moved from the impact on individuals to an impact on the institution itself. The State Department is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage.",40:21,Yovanovitch
82,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"This is not a time to undercut our diplomats. It is the responsibility of the Department’s leaders to stand up for the institution and the individuals who make that institution still today, the most effective diplomatic force in the world. And Congress has a responsibility to reinvest in our diplomacy. That’s an investment in our national security. It’s an investment in our future and our children’s future. As I close, let me be clear on who we are and how we serve this country. We are professionals. We are public servants who by vocation and training, pursue the policies of the president, regardless of who holds that office or what party they affiliate with. We handle American citizen services, facilitate trade and commerce, work security issues, represent the US and report to and advise Washington, to mention just some of our functions, and we make a difference every day. We are people who repeatedly uproot our lives, who risk and sometimes give our lives for this country.",41:20,Yovanovitch
83,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"We are the 52 Americans who 40 years ago this month, began 444 days of deprivation, torture and captivity in Tehran. We are the dozens of Americans stationed at our Embassy in Cuba, and consulates in China, who mysteriously and dangerously, and in some cases perhaps even permanently, were injured and attacked from unknown sources several years ago. And we are Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Patrick Smith, Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, people rightly called heroes for their ultimate sacrifice to this nation’s foreign policy interests in Libya eight years ago. We honor these individuals. They represent each one of you here and every American. These courageous individuals were attacked because they symbolized America.",42:35,Yovanovitch
84,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"What you need to know, what Americans need to know, is that while thankfully most of us answer the call to duty in far less dramatic ways, every foreign service officer runs the same risks, and very often, so do our families. They serve too. As individuals, as a community, we answer the call to duty to advance and protect the interests of the United States. We take our oath seriously, the same oath that each one of you take, to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same. I count myself lucky to be a Foreign Service Officer, fortunate to serve with the best America has to offer, blessed to serve the American people for the last 33 years. I thank you for your attention. I welcome your questions.",43:31,Yovanovitch
85,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Thank you, Ambassador. We count ourselves lucky to have you serve the country as you have for decades. We will now move to the 45 minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you again for appearing today. All Americans are deeply in your debt. And before I hand it over to Mr. Goldman, our staff counsel, I want to ask you about a few of the pivotal events of interest to the country. First of all, was fighting corruption in Ukraine a key element of US policy and one in which you placed the highest priority?",44:29,Yovanovitch
86,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, it was.",45:07,Yovanovitch
87,Section_1,Adam Schiff,And can you explain why?,45:12,Yovanovitch
88,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"It was important, and it was actually stated in our policy and in our strategy, it was important because corruption was undermining the integrity of the governance system in Ukraine. And as I noted in my statement, countries that have leaders that are honest and trustworthy make better partners for us. Countries where there is a level playing field for our US business makes it easier for our companies to do business there, to trade and to profit in those countries, and what had been happening since the Soviet Union, and this is very much a Soviet legacy, is that corrupt interests were undermining not only the governance, but also the economy of Ukraine. We see enormous potential in Ukraine and would like to have a more capable, more trustworthy partner there.",45:12,Yovanovitch
89,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And I know this may be awkward for you to answer since it’s a question about yourself and your reputation, but is it fair to say that you earned a reputation for being a champion of anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine?",46:11,Yovanovitch
90,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, yes.",46:24,Yovanovitch
91,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"I don’t know if you had a chance to watch George Kent’s testimony yesterday, but would you agree with his rather frank assessment that if you fight corruption, you’re going to piss off some corrupt people?",46:28,Yovanovitch
92,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,46:38,Yovanovitch
93,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And in your efforts fighting corruption to advance US policy interests, did you anger some of the corrupt leaders in Ukraine?",46:40,Yovanovitch
94,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,46:47,Yovanovitch
95,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Was one of those corrupt people Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko?,46:49,Yovanovitch
96,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, I believe so.",46:52,Yovanovitch
97,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Was another one of those corrupt people Lutsenko’s predecessor another corrupt Prosecutor General named Viktor Shokin?,46:55,Yovanovitch
98,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Apparently so, although I’ve never met him.",47:02,Yovanovitch
99,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"At some point did you come to learn that both Lutsenko and Shokin were in touch with Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s lawyer and representative?",47:05,Yovanovitch
100,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,47:13,Yovanovitch
101,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In fact, did Giuliani try to overturn a decision that you participated in to deny Shokin a visa?",47:15,Yovanovitch
102,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that is what I was told.",47:23,Yovanovitch
103,Section_1,Adam Schiff,And that was denial was based on Mr. Shokin’s corruption?,47:25,Yovanovitch
104,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s true.",47:28,Yovanovitch
105,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And was it Mr. Lutsenko, among others, who coordinated with Mr. Giuliani to pedal false accusations against you as well as the Bidens?",47:31,Yovanovitch
106,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that is my understanding.",47:41,Yovanovitch
107,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And were these smears also amplified by the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr. as well as certain hosts on Fox?",47:43,Yovanovitch
108,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, yes, that is the case.",47:53,Yovanovitch
109,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In the face of this smear campaign, did colleagues at the State Department try to get a statement of support for you from Secretary Pompeo?",47:57,Yovanovitch
110,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,48:04,Yovanovitch
111,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Were they successful?,48:05,Yovanovitch
112,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,48:07,Yovanovitch
113,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Did you come to learn that they couldn’t issue such a statement because they feared it would be undercut by the president?,48:09,Yovanovitch
114,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,48:15,Yovanovitch
115,Section_1,Adam Schiff,And then were you told that though you had done nothing wrong you did not enjoy the confidence of the president and could no longer serve as ambassador?,48:18,Yovanovitch
116,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that is correct.",48:25,Yovanovitch
117,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In fact, you flew home from Kiev on the same day as the inauguration of Ukraine’s new president?",48:28,Yovanovitch
118,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s true.,48:33,Yovanovitch
119,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"That inauguration was attended by three who have become known as the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Volker and Perry, was it?",48:35,Yovanovitch
120,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,48:42,Yovanovitch
121,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And three days after that inauguration, in a meeting with President Trump, are you aware that the president designated these three amigos to coordinate Ukraine policy with Rudy Giuliani?",48:45,Yovanovitch
122,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Since then I have become aware of that.,48:56,Yovanovitch
123,Section_1,Adam Schiff,This is the same Rudy Giuliani who orchestrated the smear campaign against you?,48:57,Yovanovitch
124,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,49:03,Yovanovitch
125,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And the same Rudy Giuliani who during the now infamous July 25th, phone call the President recommended to Zelensky in the context of the two investigations the president wanted into the 2016 election and the Bidens?",49:05,Yovanovitch
126,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,49:17,Yovanovitch
127,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And finally ambassador, in that July 25th phone call, the president praises one of these corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutors and says they were treated very unfairly. They were treated unfairly, not you was smeared and recalled, but one of them. What message does that send to your colleagues in the US Embassy in Kiev?",49:20,Yovanovitch
128,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,I’m just not sure what the basis for that kind of a statement would be. Certainly not from our reporting over years.,49:48,Yovanovitch
129,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Did you have concern though or do you have concern today about what message the president’s actions sends to the people who were still in Ukraine representing the United States when a well respected ambassador can be smeared out of her post with the participation and acquiescence of the president of the United States?,49:58,Yovanovitch
130,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, it’s I think been a big hit for morale both at the US Embassy Kiev but also more broadly, in the State Department.",50:21,Yovanovitch
131,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Is it fair to say that other ambassadors and others of lesser rank who serve the United States in embassies around the world might look at this and think if I take on corrupt people in these countries that could happen to me?,50:34,Yovanovitch
132,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think that is a fair statement, yes.",50:50,Yovanovitch
133,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Goldman.,50:53,Yovanovitch
134,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Yovanovitch, on April 24th of this year at approximately 10:00 PM, you received a telephone call while you were at the embassy in Kiev, from the Director General of the State Department, and this was just three days after President Zelensky’s election and the call between President Trump and President Zelensky that we just heard from Ranking Member, Nunes. At the time that this urgent call came in, what were you in the middle of doing?",50:55,Yovanovitch
135,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I was hosting an event in honor of Kateryna Handziuk, who is an anti-corruption activist or was an anti-corruption activist in Ukraine. We had given her the Woman of Courage award from Ukraine and in fact, the Worldwide Woman of Courage event at the Worldwide Women of Courage event in Washington DC. Secretary Pompeo singled her out for her amazing work in Ukraine to fight corrupt interest in the south of Ukraine. She very tragically died because she was attacked by acid and several months later died a very, very painful death. We thought it was important that justice be done for Kateryna Handziuk and for others to fight corruption in Ukraine because this is, it’s not a tabletop exercise. Their lives are in the balance. And so we wanted to bring attention to this. We held an event and gave her father who of course is still mourning her, that award, the Woman of Courage event.",51:33,Yovanovitch
136,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And her current Woman of Courage award stemmed from her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine?,52:47,Yovanovitch
137,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that is true.",52:52,Yovanovitch
138,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Was it ever determined who threw the acid and killed her?,52:53,Yovanovitch
139,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"There had been investigations but while some of the lower ranking individuals that were involved in this have been arrested, those who ordered this have not yet been apprehended.",52:59,Yovanovitch
140,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"After you stepped away from this anti-corruption event to take this call, what did the Director General tell you?",53:15,Yovanovitch
141,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"She said that there was a great concern on the seventh floor of the State Department, that is where the leadership of the State Department sits, there was great concern, they were worried. She just wanted to give me a heads up about this and things seem to be going on and so she just wanted to give me a heads up. I had to know how to react to something like that. I asked her what it was about, what did she think it was about. She didn’t know. She said that she was going to try and find out more but she had wanted to give me a heads up. In fact, I think she may even have been instructed to give me a heads up on that. And so I asked her, what is the next step here? So she said she would try to find out more and she would try to call me by midnight.",53:22,Yovanovitch
142,Section_1,Dan Goldman,What happened next?,54:08,Yovanovitch
143,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Around one o’clock in the morning, she called me again and she said that there were great concerns, there were concerns up the street and she said I needed to get home… come home immediately, get on the next plane to the US. And I asked her why, and she said she wasn’t sure but there were concerns about my security. I asked her, “My physical security?” Because sometimes Washington knows more than we do about these things, and she said no, she hadn’t gotten that impression that it was a physical security issue but they were concerned about my security and I needed to come home right away. I argued. This is extremely irregular and no reason given. But in the end, I did get on the next plane home.",54:10,Yovanovitch
144,Section_1,Dan Goldman,You said you… there were concerns up the street. What did you understand that to mean?,55:04,Yovanovitch
145,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,The White House.,55:08,Yovanovitch
146,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did she explain in any more detail what she meant by concerns about your security?,55:11,Yovanovitch
147,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, she didn’t. I did specifically ask whether this had to do with the Mayor Giuliani’s allegations against me and so forth, and she said she didn’t know. It didn’t even actually appear to me that she seemed to be aware of that. No, no reason was offered.",55:19,Yovanovitch
148,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did she explain what the urgency was for you to come back on the next flight?,55:39,Yovanovitch
149,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,The only thing that’s pertinent to that was that when she said that there were concerns about my security. That’s all but it was not further explained.,55:45,Yovanovitch
150,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, prior to this abrupt call back to Washington DC, had you been offered an extension of your post by the State Department?",55:53,Yovanovitch
151,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs had asked whether I would extend for another year departing in July of 2020.",56:04,Yovanovitch
152,Section_1,Dan Goldman,When was that request made?,56:14,Yovanovitch
153,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,In early March.,56:17,Yovanovitch
154,Section_1,Dan Goldman,So about a month and a half before this call?,56:19,Yovanovitch
155,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,56:21,Yovanovitch
156,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did anyone at the State Department ever express concerns about your job performance?,56:23,Yovanovitch
157,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,56:31,Yovanovitch
158,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, after you returned to Washington a couple of days after that, you met with the Deputy Secretary of State. And at your deposition, you said that Deputy Secretary of State told you that you had done nothing wrong but that there was a concerted campaign against you. What did he mean by that?",56:31,Yovanovitch
159,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I’m not exactly sure, but I took it to mean that the allegations that Mayor Giuliani and others were putting out there that that’s what it was.",56:48,Yovanovitch
160,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And who else was involved in this concerted campaign against you?,57:07,Yovanovitch
161,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,There were some members of the press and others in Mayor Giuliani’s circle.,57:11,Yovanovitch
162,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And who from Ukraine?,57:17,Yovanovitch
163,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"In Ukraine, I think, well, Mr. Lutsenko, the Prosecutor General, and Mr. Shokin, his predecessor certainly.",57:21,Yovanovitch
164,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And at this time Mr. Lutsenko was the lead Prosecutor General, is that right?",57:32,Yovanovitch
165,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that is correct.",57:36,Yovanovitch
166,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And had President Zelensky indicated whether or not he was going to keep him on after the election?,57:37,Yovanovitch
167,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,He had indicated he would not be keeping on Mr. Lutsenko.,57:43,Yovanovitch
168,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And I believe you testified earlier that Mr. Lutsenko had a reputation for being corrupt. Is that right?,57:47,Yovanovitch
169,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s correct.,57:53,Yovanovitch
170,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, during this conversation, did the Deputy Secretary tell you about your future as the ambassador to Ukraine?",57:56,Yovanovitch
171,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, he told me I needed to leave.",58:04,Yovanovitch
172,Section_1,Dan Goldman,What did he say?,58:07,Yovanovitch
173,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"He said that… I mean there was a lot of back and forth but ultimately he said the words that every foreign service officer understands, the president has lost confidence in you. That was a terrible thing to hear. And I said, “Well, I guess I have to go then.” But no real reason was offered as to why I had to leave and why it was being done in such a manner.",58:09,Yovanovitch
174,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did you have any indication that the State Department had lost confidence in you?,58:36,Yovanovitch
175,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,58:39,Yovanovitch
176,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And were you provided any reason why the president lost confidence in you?,58:42,Yovanovitch
177,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,58:49,Yovanovitch
178,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, you testified at your deposition that you were told at some point that Secretary Pompeo had tried to protect you but that he was no longer able to do that. Were you aware of these efforts to protect you?",58:49,Yovanovitch
179,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, I was not until that meeting with Deputy Secretary, Sullivan.",59:04,Yovanovitch
180,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And were you… Did you understand who he was trying to protect you from?,59:12,Yovanovitch
181,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, my understanding was that the president had wanted me to leave and there was some discussion about that over the prior months.",59:19,Yovanovitch
182,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did you have any understanding why Secretary Pompeo was no longer able to protect you?,59:31,Yovanovitch
183,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, it was just a statement made that he was no longer able to protect me.",59:37,Yovanovitch
184,Section_1,Dan Goldman,So just like that you had to leave Ukraine as soon as possible?,59:41,Yovanovitch
185,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,59:45,Yovanovitch
186,Section_1,Dan Goldman,How did that make you feel?,59:45,Yovanovitch
187,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Terrible honestly. After 33 years of service to our country, it was terrible. It is not the way I wanted my career to end.",59:48,Yovanovitch
188,Section_1,Dan Goldman,But you also told this deputy secretary that this was a dangerous precedent. What did you mean by that?,59:58,Yovanovitch
189,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I was worried about our policy, but also personnel that… and I asked him, “How are you going to explain this to people in the State Department, the press, the public, the Ukrainians because everybody is watching?” And so if people see somebody who… And of course, it had been very public, frankly, the attacks on me by Mayor Giuliani and others and Mr. Lutsenko in Ukraine, if people see that I who have been promoting our policies on anti-corruption, if they can undermine me and get me pulled out of Ukraine, what does that mean for our policy? Do we still have that same policy? How are we going to affirm it if we put that forward, number one? Number two, when other countries, other actors in other countries, see that private interests, foreign interests can come together and get a US ambassador removed, what’s going to stop them from doing that in the future in other countries?",01:00:11,Yovanovitch
190,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Often, the work we do, we try to be diplomatic about it, but as Deputy Assistant Secretary, George Kent, said, sometimes we get people really angry with us. It’s uncomfortable. And we are doing our jobs, but sometimes people become very angry with us. And if they realize that they can just remove us, they’re going to do that.",01:01:31,Yovanovitch
191,Section_1,Dan Goldman,How did the Deputy Secretary respond?,01:01:57,Yovanovitch
192,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,He said those were good questions and he would get back to me.,01:02:01,Yovanovitch
193,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did he ever get back to you?,01:02:06,Yovanovitch
194,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,He asked to see me the following day.,01:02:08,Yovanovitch
195,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And what did he say to you then?,01:02:09,Yovanovitch
196,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"He… really, the conversation was more, and again, I’m grateful for this, but really more to see how I was doing and what would I do next, kind of how could he help.",01:02:12,Yovanovitch
197,Section_1,Dan Goldman,But he didn’t address the dangerous precedent that you flagged for him?,01:02:28,Yovanovitch
198,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:02:34,Yovanovitch
199,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, you understood, of course, that the president of the United States could remove you and that you served at the pleasure of the president. Is that right?",01:02:34,Yovanovitch
200,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s right.,01:02:43,Yovanovitch
201,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"But in your 33 years as a foreign service officer, have you ever heard of a president of the United States recalling another ambassador without cause based on allegations that the State Department itself knew to be false?",01:02:44,Yovanovitch
202,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:03:00,Yovanovitch
203,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, you testified in your opening statement that you had left Ukraine by the time of the July 25th call between President Trump and President Zelensky. When was the first time that you saw the call record for this phone call?",01:03:03,Yovanovitch
204,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"When it was released publicly at the end of September, I believe.",01:03:21,Yovanovitch
205,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And prior to reading that call record, were you aware that President Trump had specifically made reference to you in that call?",01:03:25,Yovanovitch
206,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:03:33,Yovanovitch
207,Section_1,Dan Goldman,What was your reaction to learning that?,01:03:35,Yovanovitch
208,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I was shocked. Absolutely shocked and devastated, frankly.",01:03:38,Yovanovitch
209,Section_1,Dan Goldman,What you mean by devastated?,01:03:44,Yovanovitch
210,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I was shocked and devastated that I would feature in a phone call between two heads of state in such a manner where President Trump said that I was bad news to another world leader and that I would be going through some things. So I was… It was a terrible moment. A person who saw me actually reading the transcript said that the color drained from my face. I think I even had a physical reaction. I think, even now, words kind of fail me.",01:03:47,Yovanovitch
211,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Well, without upsetting you too much, I’d like to show you the excerpts from the call. And the first one where President Trump says the former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news. So I just want to let you know. What was your reaction when you heard the president of the United States refer to you as bad news?",01:04:29,Yovanovitch
212,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I couldn’t believe it. Again, shocked, appalled, devastated that the president of the United States would talk about any ambassador like that to a foreign head of state, and it was me. I couldn’t believe it.",01:05:00,Yovanovitch
213,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"The next excerpt when the president references you was a short one, but he said, “Well, she’s going to go through some things.” What did you think when President Trump told President Zelensky and you read that you were going to go through some things?",01:05:20,Yovanovitch
214,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I didn’t know what to think, but I was very concerned.",01:05:40,Yovanovitch
215,Section_1,Dan Goldman,What were you concerned about?,01:05:45,Yovanovitch
216,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,She’s going to go through some things. It didn’t sound good. It sounded like a threat.,01:05:49,Yovanovitch
217,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did you feel threatened?,01:05:57,Yovanovitch
218,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,I did.,01:06:01,Yovanovitch
219,Section_1,Dan Goldman,How so?,01:06:03,Yovanovitch
220,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I didn’t know exactly. It is not a very precise phrase, but I think it didn’t feel like I was… I really don’t know how to answer the question any further except to say that it felt like a vague threat, and so I wondered what that meant. It concerned me.",01:06:07,Yovanovitch
221,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, in this same call where the president, as you just said, threatens you, to a foreign leader, he also praises, rather, the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor who led the false smear campaign against you. I want to show you another excerpt or two from the transcript or the call record, rather, where the president of the United States says, “Good, because I heard you have had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.” And he went on later to say, “I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor, so good luck with everything.” Now, Ambassador Yovanovitch, after nearly three years in Ukraine, where you tried to clean up the Prosecutor General’s office, was it the US embassy’s view that the former Prosecutor General was a very good and very fair prosecutor?",01:06:34,Yovanovitch
222,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, it was not.",01:07:47,Yovanovitch
223,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, he was rather corrupt, is that right?",01:07:49,Yovanovitch
224,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,That was our belief.,01:07:52,Yovanovitch
225,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"The Prosecutor General’s office is a long running problem in Ukraine, is that right?",01:07:55,Yovanovitch
226,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:08:00,Yovanovitch
227,Section_1,Dan Goldman,So how did you feel when you heard President Trump speak so highly of the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor who helped to execute the smear campaign to have you removed?,01:08:02,Yovanovitch
228,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, it was disappointing, it was concerning. It wasn’t certainly based on anything that the State Department would have reported or, frankly, anybody else in the US government. There was an interagency consensus that while… When Mr. Lutsenko came into office, we were very hopeful that he would actually do the things that he said he would set out to do, including reforming the Prosecutor General’s office, but that did not materialize.",01:08:16,Yovanovitch
229,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"So this was not the uniform position of the official US policymakers, is that right?",01:08:48,Yovanovitch
230,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Right.,01:08:56,Yovanovitch
231,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, let’s go back to the smear campaign that you referenced, and in March when you said it became public, and you previously testified that you had learned that Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s lawyer and representative who was also mentioned in that July 25th call, was in regular communication with the corrupt Prosecutor General in late 2018 and in early 2019. And at one point in your deposition, you said that they, that being Giuliani and the corrupt foreign Prosecutor General, had plans to “Do things to me.” What did you mean by that?",01:08:58,Yovanovitch
232,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I didn’t really know, but that’s what I had been told by Ukrainian officials.",01:09:39,Yovanovitch
233,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did you subsequently understand a little bit more what that meant?,01:09:46,Yovanovitch
234,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, now with the advantage of hindsight, I think that meant removing me from my job in Ukraine.",01:09:50,Yovanovitch
235,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Who did you understand to be working with Mr. Giuliani as his associates in Ukraine?,01:09:55,Yovanovitch
236,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, certainly Mr. Lutsenko, Mr. Shokin. I believe that there were also Ukrainian Americans, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who have recently been indicted.",01:10:05,Yovanovitch
237,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Those who the two who have been indicted in New York?,01:10:16,Yovanovitch
238,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,The Southern District of New York.,01:10:20,Yovanovitch
239,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, at the end of March, this effort by Giuliani and his associates resulted in a series of articles in The Hill publication that were based on allegations in part from Lutsenko, the corrupt Prosecutor General, and just to summarize some of these allegations, there were among others three different categories. One category included the attacks against you, which you referenced in your opening statement, including that you had bad mouthed the president and had given the Prosecutor General a do not prosecute list. There was another that included allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, and then there was a third that related to allegations concerning Burisma and the Bidens. Is that accurate?",01:10:24,Yovanovitch
240,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, yes.",01:11:16,Yovanovitch
241,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Were these articles and allegations then promoted by others associated with the president in the United States?,01:11:18,Yovanovitch
242,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,They seemed to be promoted by those around Mayor Giuliani.,01:11:28,Yovanovitch
243,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"I’m going to show you a couple of exhibits, including a tweet here by President Trump himself on March 20th, which was the first day that one of these articles was published. It appears to be a quote that says “John Solomon: As Russia collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.” @seanhannity, @FoxNews. And then if I could go to another tweet four days later, this is the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., who tweets, “We need more @RichardGrenells,” who is the ambassador to Germany, is that right?",01:11:34,Yovanovitch
244,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s correct.,01:12:19,Yovanovitch
245,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"“And less of these jokers as ambassadors.” And it’s a retweet of one of John Solomon’s articles, or an article referencing the allegations that says, “Calls grow to remove Obama’s US ambassador to Ukraine.” Were you aware of these tweets at the time?",01:12:20,Yovanovitch
246,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:12:39,Yovanovitch
247,Section_1,Dan Goldman,What was your reaction to seeing this?,01:12:40,Yovanovitch
248,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I was worried.",01:12:42,Yovanovitch
249,Section_1,Dan Goldman,What were you worried about?,01:12:44,Yovanovitch
250,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,That this didn’t seem… These attacks were being repeated by the president himself and his son.,01:12:47,Yovanovitch
251,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And were you aware whether they received attention on prime time television on Fox News as well?,01:12:58,Yovanovitch
252,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, I did.",01:13:05,Yovanovitch
253,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, was the allegation that you were badmouthing President Trump true?",01:13:06,Yovanovitch
254,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:13:11,Yovanovitch
255,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Was the allegation that you had created a do not prosecute list to give to the Prosecutor General in Ukraine true?,01:13:13,Yovanovitch
256,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:13:21,Yovanovitch
257,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"In fact, didn’t the corrupt Prosecutor General himself later recant those allegations?",01:13:23,Yovanovitch
258,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:13:28,Yovanovitch
259,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, when these articles were first published, did the State Department issue a response?",01:13:31,Yovanovitch
260,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"As you said, there was a series of articles. So, after the first article, which was an interview with Mr. Lutsenko and was only really about me and made certain allegations about me, the State Department came out the following day with a very strong statement saying that these allegations were fabrications.",01:13:37,Yovanovitch
261,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"So, the statement addressed the falsity of the allegations themselves?",01:14:02,Yovanovitch
262,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:14:07,Yovanovitch
263,Section_1,Dan Goldman,It didn’t say anything about your job performance in any way?,01:14:07,Yovanovitch
264,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Honestly, I haven’t looked at it in a very long time. I think it was generally probably laudatory. I can’t recall.",01:14:13,Yovanovitch
265,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did anyone in the State Department raise any concerns with you or express any belief in these allegations?,01:14:19,Yovanovitch
266,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, people thought it was ridiculous.",01:14:27,Yovanovitch
267,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, after these false allegations were made against you, did you have any discussions with anyone in leadership in the State Department about a potential statement of support from the department or the secretary himself?",01:14:31,Yovanovitch
268,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, after the tweets that you just showed us, it seemed to me that if the president’s son is saying things like this, that it would be very hard to continue in my position and have authority in Ukraine unless the State Department came out pretty strongly behind me. And so, over the weekend of like March 22nd, I think that’s about the date, there was a lot of discussion on email among a number of people about what could be done. I and Under Secretary… The Under Secretary for Political Affairs called me on Sunday, and I said, “It’s really important that the secretary himself come out and be supportive, because otherwise it’s hard for me to be the kind of representative you need here.” And he said he would talk to the secretary. That’s my recollection of the call. That may not be exactly how it played out. That was my recollection.",01:14:46,Yovanovitch
269,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"This is David Hale, the Under Secretary of Political Affairs, who’s the number three person at the State Department?",01:15:57,Yovanovitch
270,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:16:03,Yovanovitch
271,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did he indicate to you that he supported such a statement of support for you?,01:16:03,Yovanovitch
272,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think he must have, because I don’t think he would have gone to the secretary if he didn’t support it. He wouldn’t bring a bad idea to the secretary of state.",01:16:09,Yovanovitch
273,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And your general understanding is that you did have the full support of the State Department, is that right?",01:16:22,Yovanovitch
274,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:16:26,Yovanovitch
275,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, during your 33 year career as a foreign service officer, did you ever hear of any serious concerns about your job performance?",01:16:29,Yovanovitch
276,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:16:38,Yovanovitch
277,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Was the statement of support ultimately issued for you?,01:16:41,Yovanovitch
278,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, it was not.",01:16:45,Yovanovitch
279,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Did you learn why not?,01:16:46,Yovanovitch
280,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, yes, I was told that there was concern on the seventh floor that if the statement of support was issued, whether by the State Department or by the secretary personally, that it could be undermined.",01:16:49,Yovanovitch
281,Section_1,Dan Goldman,How could it be undermined?,01:17:06,Yovanovitch
282,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,That the president might issue a tweet contradicting that or something to that effect.,01:17:09,Yovanovitch
283,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"So, let me see if I got this right. You were one of the most senior diplomats in the State Department, you’d been there for 33 years, you’d won numerous awards, you’d been appointed as an ambassador three times by both Republican and Democratic presidents, and the State Department would not issue a statement in support of you against false allegations because they were concerned about a tweet from the president of the United States?",01:17:16,Yovanovitch
284,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s my understanding.,01:17:46,Yovanovitch
285,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Goldman, if I could follow up on that question, it seems like an appropriate time. Ambassador Yovanovitch, as we sit here testifying the president is attacking you on Twitter, and I’d like to give you a chance to respond, I’ll read part of one of his tweets. “Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?” He goes on to say later in the tweet, “It is the US president’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.” First of all, Ambassador Yovanovitch, the Senate has a chance to confirm or deny an ambassador, do they not?",01:17:50,Yovanovitch
286,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, advise and consent.",01:18:32,Yovanovitch
287,Section_1,Adam Schiff,But would you like to respond to the president’s attack that everywhere you went turned bad?,01:18:34,Yovanovitch
288,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I don’t think I have such powers, not in Mogadishu, Somalia and not in other places. I actually think that where I’ve served over the years, I and others have demonstrably made things better for the US as well as for the countries that I’ve served in. Ukraine, for example, where there are huge challenges, including, on the issue that we are discussing today of corruption, huge challenges, but they’ve made a lot of progress since 2014, including in the years that I was there. And I think in part, the Ukrainian people get the most credit for that. But a part of that credit goes to the work of the United States and to me as the ambassador in Ukraine.",01:18:42,Yovanovitch
289,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador, you’ve shown the courage to come forward today and testify notwithstanding the fact you were urged by the White House or State Department not to, notwithstanding the fact that, as you testified earlier, the president implicitly threatened you in that call record. And now the president in real-time is attacking you. What effect do you think that has on other witnesses’ willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing?",01:19:37,Yovanovitch
290,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, it’s very intimidating.",01:20:16,Yovanovitch
291,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"It’s designed to intimidate, is it not?",01:20:19,Yovanovitch
292,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"I can’t speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.",01:20:26,Yovanovitch
293,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Well, I want to let you know, Ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously. Mr. Goldman.",01:20:31,Yovanovitch
294,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Ambassador Yovanovitch, you indicated that those same articles in March that included the smear campaign also included allegations related to Ukraine’s interference in the 2016 election and the Burisma-Biden connection. Is that right?",01:20:45,Yovanovitch
295,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:21:03,Yovanovitch
296,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"So I’m going to end my questioning where we were before, which was the July 25th call. And President Trump not only insults you and praises the corrupt Prosecutor General, but he also, as you know by now, references these two investigations. First, immediately after President Zelensky thanks President Trump for his “great support in the area of defense,” President Trump responds, “I would like you to do us a favor though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people, the server. They say Ukraine has it.” And then he goes on in that same paragraph to say, “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.” Now, Ambassador Yovanovitch, from your experience as the ambassador in Ukraine for almost three years, and understanding that President Zelensky was not in politics before he ran for president and was a new president on this call, how would you expect President Zelensky to interpret a request for a favor?",01:21:05,Yovanovitch
297,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"The US relationship for Ukraine is the single most important relationship, and so I think that President Zelensky, any president, would do what they could to lean in on a favor request. I’m not saying that that’s a yes, I’m saying they would try to lean in and see what they could do.",01:22:26,Yovanovitch
298,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Fair to say that a president of Ukraine that is so dependent on the United States would do just about anything within his power to please the president of the United States if he could?,01:22:54,Yovanovitch
299,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"If he could. I’m sure there are limits, and I understand there were a lot of discussions in the Ukrainian government about all of this, but yeah, we are an important relationship on the security side and on the political side. And so the president of Ukraine, one of the most important functions that individual has is to make sure the relationship with the US is rock solid.",01:23:08,Yovanovitch
300,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, are you familiar with these allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election?",01:23:34,Yovanovitch
301,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"There have been rumors out there about things like that, but there was nothing hard, at least nothing that I was aware of.",01:23:44,Yovanovitch
302,Section_1,Dan Goldman,There was nothing based in fact to support these allegations?,01:23:54,Yovanovitch
303,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:23:58,Yovanovitch
304,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, who was responsible for interfering and meddling in the 2016 election?",01:24:00,Yovanovitch
305,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, the US Intelligence Community has concluded that it was Russia.",01:24:07,Yovanovitch
306,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Ambassador Yovanovitch, are you aware that in February of 2017, Vladimir Putin himself promoted this theory of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election?",01:24:12,Yovanovitch
307,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Maybe I knew that once and have forgotten, but I’m not familiar with it now.",01:24:27,Yovanovitch
308,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Well, let me show you a press statement that President Putin made in a joint press conference with Viktor Orban of Hungary on February 2nd of 2017, where he says, “Second, as we all know, during the presidential campaign in the United States, the Ukrainian government adopted a unilateral position in favor of one candidate. More than that, certain oligarchs, certainly with the approval of the political leadership, funded this candidate, or female candidate, to be more precise.” Now, how would this theory of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election be in Vladimir Putin’s interest?",01:24:32,Yovanovitch
309,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, President Putin must have been aware that there were concerns in the US about Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, and what the potential was for Russian meddling in the future. So classic for an intelligence officer to try to throw off the scent and create an alternative narrative that maybe might get picked up and get some credence.",01:25:19,Yovanovitch
310,Section_1,Dan Goldman,An alternative narrative that would absolve his own wrongdoing?,01:25:46,Yovanovitch
311,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah.,01:25:50,Yovanovitch
312,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And when he talks about an oligarch and he talks about the support of the Ukrainian government, there’s also a reference in the July 25th call to a wealthy Ukrainian. Is it your understanding that what Vladimir Putin is saying here in this press statement in February 2017 is similar to what President Trump says on the July 25th call related to the 2016 election?",01:25:53,Yovanovitch
313,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Maybe.,01:26:24,Yovanovitch
314,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now let me show you another exhibit from the call related to the Bidens, which I’m sure you’re familiar with. President Trump says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.” Now, are you familiar with these allegations related to Vice President Biden?",01:26:27,Yovanovitch
315,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:27:00,Yovanovitch
316,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Do you know whether he ever went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution of anyone?,01:27:02,Yovanovitch
317,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:27:09,Yovanovitch
318,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, when Vice President Biden acted to remove the former corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine, did he do so as part of official United States policy?",01:27:09,Yovanovitch
319,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Official US policy. That was endorsed and was the policy of a number of other international stakeholders, other countries, other monetary institutions, financial institutions.",01:27:22,Yovanovitch
320,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, if he helped to remove a corrupt Ukrainian Prosecutor General who was not prosecuting enough corruption, that would increase the chances that corrupt companies in Ukraine would be investigated, isn’t that right?",01:27:36,Yovanovitch
321,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,One would think so.,01:27:54,Yovanovitch
322,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And that could include Burisma, right?",01:27:55,Yovanovitch
323,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:27:57,Yovanovitch
324,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, at the time of this call, Vice President Biden was the front runner for the Democratic nomination for president and President Trump’s potential next opponent in the election. Is it your understanding that President Trump’s request to have Vice President Biden investigated, was that part of official US policy as you knew it?",01:28:00,Yovanovitch
325,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I should say that I had, at the time of this phone call, I had already departed Ukraine two months prior.",01:28:19,Yovanovitch
326,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Right, but you’re familiar with. It didn’t change that much in two months, right?",01:28:29,Yovanovitch
327,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,It certainly would not have been the policy in May when I left.,01:28:33,Yovanovitch
328,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And were these two investigations part of the anti-corruption platform that you championed in Ukraine for three years?,01:28:38,Yovanovitch
329,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:28:49,Yovanovitch
330,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"In these investigations, do they appear to you to be to benefit the president’s personal and political interests rather than the national interest?",01:28:55,Yovanovitch
331,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, they certainly could.",01:29:05,Yovanovitch
332,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, just returning to the allegations in The Hill publication in March that were promoted by Mr. Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, were those two allegations similar to the two allegations that the president wanted President Zelensky to investigate?",01:29:07,Yovanovitch
333,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:29:26,Yovanovitch
334,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"So ultimately in the July 25th phone call with the Ukrainian president, the president of the United States endorsed the false allegations against you and the Bidens, is that right?",01:29:28,Yovanovitch
335,Section_1,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:29:44,Yovanovitch
336,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"I yield back, Mr. Chairman.",01:29:45,Yovanovitch
337,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry, please.",01:29:47,Yovanovitch
338,Section_1,Adam Schiff,The gentleman will suspend. Votes are fairly imminent. We’re going to take a brief recess. I would ask everyone to remain seated-,01:29:49,Yovanovitch
339,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry, please.",01:29:57,Yovanovitch

343,Section_1,Speaker 8,"All right, so right now there is a House floor vote that the Congressmen and women have to go with. So they are suspending the portion of this hearing. Don’t go anywhere everyone, because it will come back and then…",01:30:21,Yovanovitch
344,Section_1,Announcer,"… of our country. We take it back out now to the hearing, where this is set to begin in just about two minutes away.",00:00,Yovanovitch
345,Section_2,Adam Schiff,We will come to order.,00:57,Yovanovitch
346,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Mr. Chairman, [inaudible 00:00:58] inquiry.",00:58,Yovanovitch
347,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Gentleman will state his inquiry.,01:00,Yovanovitch
348,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Thank you, sir. It appears that counsel for the witness this morning has paper copies of the slides that were used during the questioning. If that’s true, does that mean that you and/or your team has been in coordination with him and/or her with respect to her testimony this morning? And if that’s true, how does that comport with H.Res.660 in the fairness that is purportedly associated with that resolution?",01:01,Yovanovitch
349,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"The gentleman… The TV for the witnesses wasn’t working, so they were given copies this morning. It is now 45 minutes to ranking member Nunes. [crosstalk 00:01:37].",01:26,Yovanovitch
350,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Excuse me, you said that the screen in front of them was not working?",01:37,Yovanovitch
351,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"My understanding is the screen was not working in front of them, so they were given copies so they could read along since they can’t see the screens that we can. Mr. Nunes, you’re recognized for 45 minutes along with minority counsel.",01:40,Yovanovitch
352,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"First, Mr. Chair, I want to submit for the record Senator Grassley’s letter to the Department of Justice dated July 20th, 2017. I read a portion of that into the record during my opening statement.",01:56,Yovanovitch
353,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Without objection.,02:10,Yovanovitch
354,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Ambassador, congratulate you. You’ve been down in the secret deposition meeting rooms. You’ve graduated for your performance today. Later this afternoon, I should note that for the public, that we will be back down in the basement of the Capitol, doing more of these secret depositions. Ambassador, I just have a… I don’t really have very many questions for you. You admitted in your opening statement that you don’t have any firsthand knowledge of the issues that we’re looking into. But I do want to talk a little bit about Senator Grassley very briefly. I assume that you know who Senator Grassley is.",02:14,Yovanovitch
355,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, sir, I do.",02:59,Yovanovitch
356,Section_2,Devin Nunes,Do you believe that Senator Grassley is a serious and credible elected official?,03:01,Yovanovitch
357,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I have no reason to think otherwise.,03:13,Yovanovitch
358,Section_2,Devin Nunes,Were you involved in the July 25th Trump-Zelensky phone call or preparations for the call?,03:13,Yovanovitch
359,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, I was not.",03:18,Yovanovitch

369,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, I have not.",03:52,Yovanovitch
370,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Thank you, Ambassador. I’m not exactly sure what the ambassador is doing here today. This is the House Intelligence Committee that’s now turned into the House Impeachment Committee. This seems more appropriate for the Subcommittee on Human Resources at the Foreign Affairs Committee. If there’s issues with employment disagreements with the administration, it would seem like this would be a more appropriate setting instead of an impeachment hearing where the ambassador is not a material fact witness to anything, any of the accusations that are being hurled at the president for this impeachment inquiry.",03:54,Yovanovitch
371,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"I have several questions I think Mr. Castor wants to get to. I know Miss Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. Yield to you, Miss Stefanik.",04:37,Yovanovitch

383,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"This is the fifth time you have interrupted members, duly elected members of Congress.",05:17,Yovanovitch
384,Section_2,Adam Schiff,You’re not recognized. The gentlewoman will suspend.,05:23,Yovanovitch
385,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Mr. Chair, we control the time. It’s been customary to this committee that whoever controls the time can yield to whoever they wish. If we have members of Congress that have a few questions, it seems appropriate that we be able to let Miss Stefanik ask her questions.",05:25,Yovanovitch
386,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Nunes, you or minority council are recognized.",05:42,Yovanovitch
387,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"All right. Mr. Castor, you’re recognized.",05:45,Yovanovitch
388,Section_2,S. Castor,"Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador, welcome. Thank you for your service. 33 years, an extraordinary career. It really has been a remarkable tenure for you at the State Department. Also, I’d like to thank you for participating here today. This is a crazy environment. This hearing room is turned into a television studio. Before today, you spent… On Friday the 11th, you were with us for early in the morning until I believe it was eight o’clock at night. People missed trains back to New York, and it was a very complete day. So thank you.",05:51,Yovanovitch
389,Section_2,S. Castor,"You were serving a three-year assignment in the Ukraine, is that correct?",06:39,Yovanovitch
390,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,06:44,Yovanovitch
391,Section_2,S. Castor,And it began in 2016 and was scheduled to end in 2019?,06:45,Yovanovitch
392,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s correct.",06:51,Yovanovitch
393,Section_2,S. Castor,"Nobody disputes that it’s up to the president to decide who his envoys are to posts around the world, correct?",06:55,Yovanovitch
394,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I stated that clearly in my statement.,07:06,Yovanovitch
395,Section_2,S. Castor,"You returned from the Ukraine on May 20th, 2019?",07:09,Yovanovitch
396,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s correct.,07:14,Yovanovitch
397,Section_2,S. Castor,And your return coincided with the inauguration of President Zelensky?,07:16,Yovanovitch
398,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,07:21,Yovanovitch
399,Section_2,S. Castor,And you remain employed by the State Department?,07:24,Yovanovitch
400,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I do.,07:27,Yovanovitch
401,Section_2,S. Castor,"And after you returned to Washington, the deputy secretary, John Sullivan, asked you what you wanted to do next, is that correct?",07:29,Yovanovitch
402,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s correct.",07:38,Yovanovitch
403,Section_2,S. Castor,"And then you met with the director general, Ambassador Perez?",07:40,Yovanovitch
404,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes. That’s correct.,07:44,Yovanovitch
405,Section_2,S. Castor,To identify a meaningful new assignment?,07:46,Yovanovitch
406,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,07:51,Yovanovitch
407,Section_2,S. Castor,And you now serve at Georgetown University as a fellow?,07:52,Yovanovitch
408,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s true.,07:56,Yovanovitch
409,Section_2,S. Castor,And this is a rewarding position for you?,07:56,Yovanovitch
410,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I’m very grateful to be in that position after what happened.,08:02,Yovanovitch
411,Section_2,S. Castor,"Today is the second big hearing for the Democrats’ impeachment initiative. But we don’t understand… or we do understand that you don’t have a lot of facts and information relating to the part of this that we’re investigating. And those are the events from May 20th up until September 11th, the release of the security assistance funds, is that correct?",08:06,Yovanovitch
412,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s correct.",08:36,Yovanovitch
413,Section_2,S. Castor,"So you were not part of the delegation to the inauguration; that was the day you returned. You were not part of the Oval Office meeting May 23rd, correct?",08:37,Yovanovitch
414,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s correct.",08:48,Yovanovitch
415,Section_2,S. Castor,And you were not part of the decision-making relating to whether there would be a White House meeting with President Zelensky?,08:50,Yovanovitch
416,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s correct.,08:56,Yovanovitch
417,Section_2,S. Castor,You were not a part of any decision-making in the lead-up to the the July 25th call?,08:59,Yovanovitch
418,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s correct.,09:06,Yovanovitch
419,Section_2,S. Castor,"And you first learned about the call on September 25th, is that correct?",09:08,Yovanovitch
420,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I heard about the call, as I indicated in the first deposition, from Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent.",09:15,Yovanovitch
421,Section_2,S. Castor,And what did he tell you about the call?,09:24,Yovanovitch
422,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, as it turns out, it wasn’t correct, but what I recall is that he said that President Trump had asked President Zelensky whether he could help him out and which I understood to be these investigations. And that President Zelensky had said that he is putting in a new prosecutor general and that he doesn’t control… I mean, this is approximately what he said, that that person is an independent individual.",09:29,Yovanovitch
423,Section_2,S. Castor,Okay. And you learned about that before the call was made public?,10:06,Yovanovitch
424,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s correct.,10:09,Yovanovitch
425,Section_2,S. Castor,"Likewise, you were not involved in any discussions surrounding the security sector assistance funds to Ukraine? That they were paused for about 55 days from July 18th to September 11th?",10:12,Yovanovitch
426,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No discussions.,10:24,Yovanovitch
427,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay. In your opening statement on page nine, you stated, “… although then and now I’ve always understood that I served at the pleasure of the President, I still find it difficult to comprehend that foreign and private interests were able to undermine US interests in this way. Individuals who apparently felt stymied by our efforts to promote stated US policy against corruption, that is, to do the mission, were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against the sitting ambassador using unofficial back channels.” Do you believe that President Trump was aiming to weaponize corruption in Ukraine by removing you?",10:25,Yovanovitch
428,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I don’t know that.,11:15,Yovanovitch
429,Section_2,S. Castor,Okay. Do you believe your removal was part of some scheme to make it easier for elements of the Ukrainian establishment to do things counter to US interests?,11:16,Yovanovitch
430,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think that’s certainly what the Ukrainian establishment hoped. I think that in addition, there were Americans, these two individuals who were working with Mayor Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman who have recently been indicted by the Southern District of New York, who indicated that they wanted change out the ambassador. And I think they must’ve had some reason for that.",11:31,Yovanovitch
431,Section_2,S. Castor,And do you think they were seeking a different type of ambassador that would allow them to achieve some of their objectives?,11:58,Yovanovitch
432,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I don’t know what other reason there would be.,12:08,Yovanovitch
433,Section_2,S. Castor,Okay. Is Ambassador Taylor the type of person that would facilitate those objectives?,12:11,Yovanovitch
434,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,12:19,Yovanovitch
435,Section_2,S. Castor,So Ambassador Taylor is a man of high integrity?,12:19,Yovanovitch
436,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Absolutely.,12:21,Yovanovitch
437,Section_2,S. Castor,And he’s a good pick for the post?,12:23,Yovanovitch
438,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,He is. I would note that he is the chargé out there as of course you understand. So no ambassador has yet been… or no candidate has yet been named to the position.,12:25,Yovanovitch
439,Section_2,S. Castor,But he certainly has had a decorated career serving his country?,12:37,Yovanovitch
440,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Absolutely. A man of the highest integrity.,12:42,Yovanovitch
441,Section_2,S. Castor,You testified about when you first learned that Mayor Giuliani and some of his associates were… had a concerted campaign against you. When did that first come to your attention?,12:49,Yovanovitch
442,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"We were picking up rumors from Ukrainians, I think, kind of in the November-December 2018 time period. But then in January, February, and of course March, it became more obvious.",13:05,Yovanovitch
443,Section_2,S. Castor,At some point I believe you testified that Minister Avakov alerted you to this campaign?,13:31,Yovanovitch
444,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,13:32,Yovanovitch
445,Section_2,S. Castor,When was that?,13:33,Yovanovitch
446,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,He had a conversation with me in February of 2019.,13:35,Yovanovitch
447,Section_2,S. Castor,Okay. And do you remember what he related to you?,13:43,Yovanovitch
448,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes. He said that Mr. Lutsenko was working with Mayor Giuliani through these two individuals, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. That they basically wanted to remove me from post, and that they were working on that.",13:47,Yovanovitch
449,Section_2,S. Castor,And did you have any awareness at that point in time of precisely why they were seeking your ouster?,14:13,Yovanovitch
450,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"You know, I didn’t understand that at all, because I had never met Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. And so it was unclear to me why they were interested in doing this.",14:23,Yovanovitch
451,Section_2,S. Castor,Were you especially influential implementing policies that stymied their interests in Ukraine? Or advocating for some sort of environment or policies that would be adverse to them?,14:37,Yovanovitch
452,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think that just the general idea that obviously US ambassadors, US embassies, one of our most important functions is to facilitate US business abroad, right? Whether it’s trade, whether it’s commerce, that’s one of the things that we do. But everything has to be above board. We believe in a level playing ground and so forth, but we obviously advocate for US business. These two individuals, with hindsight and what we learned later, looking to open up a new energy company exporting liquefied natural gas to Ukraine, never actually came to the embassy, which is unusual. Because that would usually be a first-off, going to the American Chamber of Commerce, going to the US Embassy, get the lay of the land, see how we could provide assistance.",14:59,Yovanovitch
453,Section_2,S. Castor,And was that source of frustration ever expressed to you? Or did you just learn that separately?,15:54,Yovanovitch
454,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Source of frustration? What do you mean? On whose part?,16:01,Yovanovitch
455,Section_2,S. Castor,On Fruman and Parnas.,16:04,Yovanovitch
456,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I don’t know that they were frustrated. I mean, I… Frustrated by what?",16:08,Yovanovitch
457,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay. Well, you mentioned that they had business interests and I asked you whether they had been stymied by anything in particular that you had advocated for, or you were a roadblock to them being successful. I wondered if there was any connection.",16:13,Yovanovitch
458,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I’d never met them. When I heard those names for the first time, which was in February of 2019, I asked my team. The econ and the commercial sections are the ones who would usually meet with American businessmen and women. And nobody had heard of them. So all I can conclude is that it was the general US policies that we were implementing that might’ve been of concern to them.",16:29,Yovanovitch
459,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay. And at any point, did you ever try to reach out to the prosecutor general, Mr. Lutsenko, and find out why he was participating in this concerted campaign?",16:57,Yovanovitch
460,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,17:11,Yovanovitch
461,Section_2,S. Castor,"And then, why didn’t you do that?",17:11,Yovanovitch
462,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I didn’t feel that there was any purpose to it.,17:13,Yovanovitch
463,Section_2,S. Castor,And why not?,17:16,Yovanovitch
464,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"He is… He clearly had, I would say, an animus for doing this. And he was working with Americans, so I reached out to the American side, in this case the State Department, to try and find out what was going on.",17:18,Yovanovitch
465,Section_2,S. Castor,When did you first realize that your relationship with Lutsenko had reached a adversarial point?,17:40,Yovanovitch
466,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Probably around that time, maybe a little bit earlier.",17:49,Yovanovitch
467,Section_2,S. Castor,And this is March?,17:53,Yovanovitch
468,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah. And what I would say, adversarial, that’s a really strong word. We at the US Embassy or our visiting key people from the State Department and other agencies, we were pushing the Ukrainians, including Mr. Lutsenko, to do what they said that they were going to do when Mr. Lutsenko entered office. That he was going to clean up the PGO and make reforms, that he was going to bring justice to the what they call the Heavenly Hundred, the people who died on the Maidan in 2014, the Revolution of Dignity. And he was going to prosecute cases to repatriate approximately $40 billion it’s believed that former President Yanukovych and his cronies fled the country with. And he didn’t do any of that.",17:53,Yovanovitch
469,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"And we kept on trying to encourage him to do the right thing. That’s what the Ukrainian people wanted him to do, and we thought it was a good plan and that he should do it.",18:46,Yovanovitch
470,Section_2,S. Castor,All right. And then you mentioned you contacted the State Department in late March. Was that under Secretary Hale?,18:58,Yovanovitch
471,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,So contacted about what?,19:08,Yovanovitch
472,Section_2,S. Castor,About the concerns you had about the campaign against you?,19:09,Yovanovitch
473,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I contacted the State Department much earlier than that. I mean, it was an ongoing sort of… “discussion” makes it sound very formal. We have many ways of going back and forth with Washington. And so, on phone calls or DVCs, we would have this discussion.",19:13,Yovanovitch
474,Section_2,S. Castor,When did you realize this?,19:33,Yovanovitch
475,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"And if I could just amplify my answer, we had the discussion because we were concerned that Ukrainian policymakers, Ukrainian leaders, were hearing that I was going to be leaving, that there was maybe somebody else waiting in the wings, et cetera. And that undermined not only my position, but our US position. The Ukrainians didn’t know what to think. And we need to be out there all the time firing on all cylinders to promote our national security interest. So it was a concern.",19:35,Yovanovitch
476,Section_2,S. Castor,And when did you realize this concerted campaign against you was a real threat?,20:14,Yovanovitch
477,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,A threat in…?,20:20,Yovanovitch
478,Section_2,S. Castor,A threat to your ability to do the job in Kyiv?,20:21,Yovanovitch
479,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I would say that the… When you go into a meeting with somebody and they ask, “Are you going to be leaving?” that is concerning. So that probably… I don’t know exactly when that started happening, but in that timeframe.",20:26,Yovanovitch
480,Section_2,S. Castor,And did you undertake any efforts to push back on this narrative either inside the State Department or publicly?,20:45,Yovanovitch
481,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, certainly with the Ukrainians, I said, “There’s nothing to this. This is a distraction, and we are focused on the job. Our policy remains the same.” And, yes, we had discussions in the State Department about this.",20:52,Yovanovitch
482,Section_2,S. Castor,"In hindsight, do you think you did enough inside the State Department to alert them to this mounting campaign against you?",21:08,Yovanovitch
483,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I did what I could.,21:17,Yovanovitch
484,Section_2,S. Castor,And what was that?,21:19,Yovanovitch
485,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Reached out to the the European Bureau. I think you’ve also heard that Dr. Fiona Hill was aware of this as well, so the NSC. And they had other discussions with more senior people.",21:21,Yovanovitch
486,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay. Did you get any feedback from your chain of command? I mean, did you engage Ambassador Reeker-",21:37,Yovanovitch
487,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,21:46,Yovanovitch
488,Section_2,S. Castor,… And Under Secretary Hale?,21:46,Yovanovitch
489,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes. Yes.,21:47,Yovanovitch
490,Section_2,S. Castor,And did you develop sort of a game plan to push back against these allegations?,21:48,Yovanovitch
491,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"So, they’re different timeframes here that we’re talking about. So fast-forwarding to March, I did, when Under Secretary Hale asked whether I would consider extending, I did raise, because I wasn’t sure that he was aware of it. I wanted to make sure that he knew that Mayor Giuliani had been out there saying things about me, untrue things, and I wanted him to be aware of that. And he said he understood. He still was hoping that I could extend for another year. So that was early March.",21:53,Yovanovitch
492,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"And then fast-forward to late March, and the discussions about this issue continued, but obviously it became… Once it became a public political story here in the United States, the tenor of everything changed. Because I think that the State Department felt that it wasn’t manageable anymore and that the more prudent thing would be for me to come back in July.",22:31,Yovanovitch
493,Section_2,S. Castor,"Do you think there was anything you could’ve done differently to get ahead of the story? And to lobby the Secretary and his counselor, Mr. Brechbuhl, that there was a concerted campaign against you, that you didn’t believe the allegations lodged were accurate and you needed their assistance?",23:03,Yovanovitch
494,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think that, sure, maybe I could’ve done that, but I think they were aware. And as I subsequently learned from Deputy Secretary Sullivan, the Secretary of State had been well aware of this since the summer of 2018.",23:19,Yovanovitch
495,Section_2,S. Castor,"The corruption is endemic in the country of Ukraine, right?",23:35,Yovanovitch
496,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I would say that corruption is a serious issue everywhere in the former Soviet Union. It’s a post-Soviet legacy. And we talk about it a lot in Ukraine, because there’s actually an opportunity to do something, to actually help the Ukrainians tackle the issue. They want to tackle the issue. In other countries like Russia, you can’t even talk about it. So I think it’s a post-Soviet legacy, and it’s important to deal with it.",23:41,Yovanovitch
497,Section_2,S. Castor,And you testified rampant corruption has long permeated Ukraine’s political and economic systems?,24:09,Yovanovitch
498,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes. That’s a fair statement.,24:16,Yovanovitch
499,Section_2,S. Castor,And it’s your belief that it should be the US foreign policy to help Ukraine curb its corruption problem?,24:17,Yovanovitch
500,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, because it’s good for the Ukrainians, but it’s also in our interest.",24:23,Yovanovitch
501,Section_2,S. Castor,And anti-corruption efforts you mentioned serve a national security purpose?,24:30,Yovanovitch
502,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I believe that to be true.,24:35,Yovanovitch
503,Section_2,S. Castor,Are oligarchs a big part of the problem in Ukraine?,24:39,Yovanovitch
504,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Probably because so much wealth is concentrated in the hands of a very, very few, six or seven individuals, and they also have political power and control the medium.",24:45,Yovanovitch
505,Section_2,S. Castor,And a lot of their power has been acquired through what we here in the US would consider improper ways?,25:00,Yovanovitch
506,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, I think that’s a fair comment.",25:08,Yovanovitch
507,Section_2,S. Castor,"The head of Burisma, Mr. Zlochevsky. You familiar with him?",25:13,Yovanovitch
508,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I don’t know him, but I know who you’re talking about.",25:20,Yovanovitch
509,Section_2,S. Castor,"George Kent testified a couple of days ago that he was investigating for stealing millions and millions of dollars, some of which had been supplied by the US, Great Britain, subject to an investigation trying to get the money back. That was a big part of Mr. Kent’s initiatives when he was there. That a bribe was paid to the prosecutors and Zlochevsky was let off the hook. This was in 2014. Is this something that you’re familiar with?",25:23,Yovanovitch
510,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I’ve heard about it. This was before my arrival. And I would just say my understanding, but please correct me if I’m wrong, is that the US money that you’re referring to was the money that we used to fund an FBI team that was embedded with the Prosecutor General’s Office to go after… not to go after, but to do the investigation of Burisma and Zlochevsky.",26:01,Yovanovitch
511,Section_2,S. Castor,"Mr. Kent testified that this bribe was paid, that prosecution went away, and essentially nothing has been further done with regards to Burisma. During your tenure in Ukraine, has there ever been any focus on re-examining allegations, whether it’s Burisma or other powerful interests, like Zlochevsky? Re-examining it?",26:37,Yovanovitch
512,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Is that on the part of the Ukrainian government? Is that what you’re talking about?,27:08,Yovanovitch
513,Section_2,S. Castor,"Yeah, trying to lean on the various prosecutors general to clean up the oligarchical system.",27:11,Yovanovitch
514,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think, yes, there have been some efforts. And as I mentioned earlier in my testimony, the US was welcoming of Mr. Lutsenko’s nomination to the position of prosecutor general, because we were hoping he would clean that up. That, in fact, is not what happened. It’s kind of hard to explain to a US audience, but in Ukraine, and in the former Soviet Union more broadly, including in Russia, the justice system, whether it’s cops on the beat, whether it’s investigators, whether it is prosecutors, whether it is judges, are used as a tool of the political system, to be used against your political adversaries.",27:16,Yovanovitch
515,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"And so, I think that, going back to your question about Burisma and Zlochevsky, my understanding… This was, as I told you earlier in the previous deposition, this did not loom large when I arrived. I arrived in 2016, August 2016, but over time, my understanding was that the case was basically sort of on a pause. That it wasn’t an active case, but it also was not fully closed. And that is a way, as I mentioned before, for those in power to keep a little hook in to Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky.",28:13,Yovanovitch
516,Section_2,S. Castor,"And right around the time that the bribe was paid, Burisma undertook an effort to spruce up their board and they added, I believe, the president of Poland and some other luminaries. Are you familiar with that?",29:01,Yovanovitch
517,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, I don’t exactly know what the timing of all of this was. But, yes. I mean, to the elements.",29:12,Yovanovitch
518,Section_2,S. Castor,"One of the folks they added to the board was the vice president’s son, Hunter Biden, which raises questions. Is he a genius on the corporate governance front? Is he a genius with the Ukrainian oligarchical systems and cleaning that up? Or was he just added to the board because he’s the vice president’s son? Was that ever a concern, or at least the perception of that concern addressed?",29:18,Yovanovitch
519,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"As I said, I arrived in August of 2016, several months before the elections and several months before President Trump took office. And it was not a focus of what I was doing in that six-month period.",29:47,Yovanovitch
520,Section_2,S. Castor,Was the issue ever raised at all?,30:07,Yovanovitch
521,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Not…,30:10,Yovanovitch
522,Section_2,S. Castor,"He was still on the board, I think, at the time.",30:11,Yovanovitch
523,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, my understanding from newspaper accounts is that he just recently left, in 2019. I never met him. Never talked to him. And I’m sorry, what was your question?",30:13,Yovanovitch
524,Section_2,S. Castor,"He was still on the board when you arrived at post, and was just wondering if at least the perception problem was brought to your attention as the ambassador?",30:26,Yovanovitch
525,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I was aware of it, because as I told you before in the deposition, there had been a… In terms of the preparation for my Senate confirmation hearings for Ukraine, there was a question about that and a select answer. So I was aware of it. Yes.",30:37,Yovanovitch
526,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay. In your deposition, you acknowledged that the president has longstanding concerns about corruption in Ukraine. Is that true?",30:56,Yovanovitch
527,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s what he says.,31:08,Yovanovitch
528,Section_2,S. Castor,"Going back to… There was a meeting with President Poroshenko in September of 2017 in the Oval Office, and I believe you testified that he expressed his concerns then.",31:11,Yovanovitch
529,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, he said that a friend of his had told him that Ukraine was the most corrupt country in the world.",31:23,Yovanovitch
530,Section_2,S. Castor,Okay. Several witnesses have testified that the president has concerns that there are certain elements of the Ukrainian establishment that during 2016 were out to get him. Is that something you were aware of at any point in time?,31:34,Yovanovitch
531,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I’m certainly aware of it now. Obviously, there’s been a lot of press attention on that. It was not brought to my attention during the two and a half years that I served under President Trump as our ambassador to Ukraine.",31:51,Yovanovitch
532,Section_2,S. Castor,"We’ve gone through the deposition. Some of these elements that… maybe they loom larger now, but in hindsight, was there any discussion at the embassy that there’s these indications of some Ukrainians trying to at least advocate against then-candidate Trump?",32:10,Yovanovitch
533,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Actually there weren’t. We didn’t really see it that way.,32:32,Yovanovitch
534,Section_2,S. Castor,"And were you aware, I know Mr. Nunes mentioned this earlier, the consultant Alexandra Chalupa had reportedly, at least according to her and according to Ken Vogel at the Politico, was trying to work with the Ukrainian embassy in DC to trade information, share leads of that sort of thing?",32:37,Yovanovitch
535,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I saw the article. I didn’t have any further information about that.,33:00,Yovanovitch
536,Section_2,S. Castor,"And did you see the article at the time, or did that only come to your attention subsequently?",33:06,Yovanovitch
537,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,It’s certainly been brought to my attention subsequently. I think I did see something to that effect at the time as well.,33:13,Yovanovitch
538,Section_2,S. Castor,"And you’re the ambassador in-country at this point. Did you aim to get to the bottom of that? Because if true, if the reporting’s true, if what Miss Chalupa told Mr. Vogel is accurate, that would be concerning, correct?",33:18,Yovanovitch
539,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I was the ambassador in Ukraine starting in August of 2016 and what you’re describing, if true, as you said, what you’re describing took place in the United States. So if there were concerns about what Miss Chalupa was doing, I think that that would have been handled here.",33:39,Yovanovitch
540,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,… Miss Chalupa was doing. I think that would have been handled here.,34:03,Yovanovitch
541,Section_2,S. Castor,And do you know Miss Chalupa?,34:04,Yovanovitch
542,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I don’t believe so.,34:06,Yovanovitch
543,Section_2,S. Castor,Have you ever met her?,34:07,Yovanovitch
544,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I don’t think so. I mean, if she worked for the Ukrainian Embassy it’s possible that I met her in a large group or something, but I don’t believe I know her.",34:08,Yovanovitch
545,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay. Are you aware of the role that investigative journalist, Mr. Leshchenko, played in publicizing the Manafort black ledgers?",34:16,Yovanovitch
546,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,34:28,Yovanovitch
547,Section_2,S. Castor,"And he publicized some information in a pretty grand way in August of 2016, and almost immediately coincided with Mr. Manafort leaving the Trump campaign. Was there anything about that issue, when it was occurring, that concerned you?",34:28,Yovanovitch
548,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I certainly noticed it, because I was a week or so away from arriving in Ukraine. I think that, from a Ukrainian perspective … I realize we are looking at this from an American perspective. From a Ukrainian perspective, I think that what Mr. Leshchenko and others who were looking into the black ledger were most concerned about was actually not Mr. Manafort but former President Yanukovych, and his political party, and the amount of money that they allegedly stole, and where it went, and so forth. I mean, I think there’s just a difference in perspective, depending on which country you’re in.",34:50,Yovanovitch
549,Section_2,S. Castor,"But you can understand the president, at least from his perspective, looking at these facts, it certainly is reasonable to conclude that there are elements of the Ukrainian establishment that are advocating against him, at this point in time, correct?",35:32,Yovanovitch
550,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, just speaking about Mr. Leshchenko, he’s an investigative journalist, as you said, and he got access to the black ledger, and he published it, as I think journalists would do. And again, I’m not sure that that … I don’t have any information to suggest that that was being … that was targeting President Trump.",35:46,Yovanovitch
551,Section_2,S. Castor,"But the way the events unfolded, I mean, Mr. Manafort was … subsequently left the campaign, and it certainly did begin a period of interest in Manafort’s ties to Russia, and so forth.",36:09,Yovanovitch
552,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Again, I think that that may have been the effect here in the United States. And obviously, it was of interest to journalists and others here that Mr. Manafort was former President Yanukovych’s political advisor, and he was the political advisor, head of a campaign here, and so, we all know that there have been court cases and so forth where Mr. Manafort was found guilty of certain actions. But at the end of the day, President Trump won the elections.",36:32,Yovanovitch
553,Section_2,S. Castor,"With Mr. Leshchenko’s reporting, I mean, there’s been a question of whether all the information that he published was authentic, correct?",37:05,Yovanovitch
554,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I’m sorry, could you repeat that?",37:13,Yovanovitch
555,Section_2,S. Castor,Some have questioned whether the information Mr. Leshchenko published was all correct or whether it was doctored.,37:16,Yovanovitch
556,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Okay. I wasn’t aware of that.,37:25,Yovanovitch
557,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay. Ambassador Chaly, during the August timeframe, he wrote an op-ed in The Hill taking issue with then candidate Trump. Were you aware of that when it occurred?",37:30,Yovanovitch
558,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,37:41,Yovanovitch
559,Section_2,S. Castor,And did you have any communications with the ambassador to express concerns?,37:41,Yovanovitch
560,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,37:48,Yovanovitch
561,Section_2,S. Castor,"And how frequently did you communicate with the ambassador? Obviously, you’re in different posts in different countries, but-",37:48,Yovanovitch
562,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah. Didn’t actually see him or talk to him that often.,37:56,Yovanovitch
563,Section_2,S. Castor,So you weren’t in frequent communication?,38:01,Yovanovitch
564,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,38:04,Yovanovitch
565,Section_2,S. Castor,"Can you see how writing an op-ed even given the substance … We’ve discussed the substance of it, that there’s sensitivities, but can you see how just the simple fact of writing an op-ed, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US might create a perception that there are elements of the Ukrainian establishment that were advocating against then candidate Trump?",38:04,Yovanovitch
566,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,My recollection of that op-ed was that he was taking a … He was critical of a policy position that President Trump had with regard to Crimea and whether Crimea was a part of Ukraine or a part of Russia. That’s a tremendously sensitive issue in Ukraine and my recollection is that that is what Ambassador Chaly was writing about.,38:26,Yovanovitch
567,Section_2,S. Castor,And do you know whether the ambassador or anybody from the embassy tried to make contact with the Trump camp to talk about their concerns before lodging an op-ed?,38:55,Yovanovitch
568,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I don’t know.,39:06,Yovanovitch
569,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay. During the same time period, in the run up to the election, the Minister Avakov had said some especially candid things about then candidate Trump on some various social media platforms. Are you aware of that?",39:10,Yovanovitch
570,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes. As a result of the deposition, the previous deposition.",39:28,Yovanovitch
571,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay, but during the relevant time period when it was happening, you weren’t aware of that?",39:32,Yovanovitch
572,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I don’t recall it.,39:38,Yovanovitch
573,Section_2,S. Castor,"Okay. He’s one of the more influential officials in the Ukraine, correct?",39:39,Yovanovitch
574,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,He is.,39:45,Yovanovitch
575,Section_2,S. Castor,I believe he’s one of the few that span both the Poroshenko administration and the Zelensky administration?,39:47,Yovanovitch
576,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s correct.",39:54,Yovanovitch
577,Section_2,S. Castor,"Looking back on his comments in hindsight, do you see how that might create a perception that a very influential Ukrainian was advocating against then candidate Trump?",39:58,Yovanovitch
578,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That he was doing what? I’m sorry.,40:10,Yovanovitch
579,Section_2,S. Castor,"He was out to get him. I mean, he said some real nasty things.",40:12,Yovanovitch
580,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, sometimes that happens on social media and I … Are you asking me whether it’s appropriate? Probably not, but I would say that Minister Avakov has been, as well as others, both in President Poroshenko’s administration, as well as in the Zelensky administration, has been a good partner to the United States. As I think I told you before, he’s a very practical man and looking for partners in getting the job done.",40:17,Yovanovitch
581,Section_2,S. Castor,"I’m shocked that social media would be the site of negative comments. You certainly can understand that the president aware of Minister Avakov’s statements, aware of what Mr. Leshchenko was up to, what Ambassador Chaly was up to, and these other elements that we’ve discussed that there’s certainly forms of reasonable basis to wonder whether there are influential elements of the Ukrainian establishment that were out to get the president.",40:52,Yovanovitch
582,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Again, I mean, I can’t speak for what President Trump thought or what others thought. I would just say that those elements that you’ve recited don’t seem to me to be the Ukrainian … kind of a plan or plot of the Ukrainian government to work against President Trump or anyone else. I mean, they’re isolated incidents. We all know, I’m coming to find out myself, that public life can be … People are critical and that does not mean that someone is or a government is undermining either a campaign or interfering in elections. I would just remind again that our own US intelligence community has conclusively determined that the those who interfered in the election were in Russia.",41:32,Yovanovitch
583,Section_2,S. Castor,Turn our attention to Ambassador Volker. He’s been a friend and colleague of yours for many years. Is that correct?,42:35,Yovanovitch
584,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s true. Could I have water?",42:41,Yovanovitch
585,Section_2,S. Castor,And I believe you testified he’s a man of honor?,42:44,Yovanovitch
586,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I believe that to be true.,42:47,Yovanovitch
587,Section_2,S. Castor,And a brilliant diplomat?,42:48,Yovanovitch
588,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,42:51,Yovanovitch
589,Section_2,S. Castor,And you have no reason to think that he would be undertaking any initiative that was counter to US interests?,42:52,Yovanovitch
590,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I think that he tried to do what he thought was right.,43:02,Yovanovitch
591,Section_2,S. Castor,"Turning our attention to the Trump administration’s policy of aid, the aid package to Ukraine. You’ve testified that during your tenure as ambassador America’s policy actually got stronger toward Ukraine. Is that accurate?",43:15,Yovanovitch
592,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"With the provision of Javelins to the Ukrainian military, Yes. That was really positive.",43:32,Yovanovitch
593,Section_2,S. Castor,And why was that important?,43:38,Yovanovitch
594,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, two things. They are, obviously, tank busters and so if the war with Russia all of a sudden accelerated in some way and tanks come over the horizon, Javelins are a very serious weapon to deal with that. That’s number one. But really the more important issue is the symbolism of it, that the United States is providing Javelins to Ukraine. That makes Ukraine’s adversaries think twice.",43:40,Yovanovitch
595,Section_2,S. Castor,The provision of Javelins to Ukraine was blocked during the previous administration. Is that correct?,44:10,Yovanovitch
596,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think they made a determination … I was not a part of those discussions, but obviously, they had not yet made a determination about whether to provide Javelins.",44:18,Yovanovitch
597,Section_2,S. Castor,But do you have any understanding of what the interagency consensus was with regard to Javelins during the previous administration?,44:29,Yovanovitch
598,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I think that most in the interagency wanted to provide Javelins to Ukraine.,44:40,Yovanovitch
599,Section_2,S. Castor,"And so in the new administration under President Trump, the ability to afford Ukraine this weaponry is a significant advantage, significant step forward?",44:43,Yovanovitch
600,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,We thought it was important.,44:53,Yovanovitch
601,Section_2,S. Castor,And has it played out that way?,44:56,Yovanovitch
602,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, it has.",44:59,Yovanovitch
603,Section_2,S. Castor,Provision of Javelins.,45:03,Yovanovitch
604,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Because it’s a symbol of our strong support for Ukraine, but when then … This year there are questions as to whether or not our security assistance is going to go through. That kind of undermines that strong message of support.",45:03,Yovanovitch
605,Section_2,S. Castor,"Ukraine still has the ability to acquire the Javelins though, correct?",45:26,Yovanovitch
606,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Are you now talking about purchasing Javelins-,45:31,Yovanovitch
607,Section_2,S. Castor,Purchasing-,45:33,Yovanovitch
608,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,… by the Ukrainian government?,45:38,Yovanovitch
609,Section_2,S. Castor,Yeah.,45:38,Yovanovitch
610,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, they do. That is my understanding [crosstalk 00:45:39]",45:39,Yovanovitch
611,Section_2,S. Castor,"And the security sector assistance did go through. It was paused for 55 days from July 18th to September 11th but it ultimately went through, correct?",45:39,Yovanovitch
612,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s my understanding.,45:46,Yovanovitch
613,Section_2,S. Castor,Okay. You testified during your deposition that you were proud of the efforts of the United States during your tenure to supply this type of aid to Ukraine. Are you still happy with the decisions?,45:47,Yovanovitch
614,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Are you talking about the Javelin?,46:16,Yovanovitch
615,Section_2,S. Castor,The Javelin and also just the whole aid package.,46:16,Yovanovitch
616,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,46:21,Yovanovitch
617,Section_2,S. Castor,Do you think it’s sufficient? Do you think we’re giving Ukraine enough money?,46:21,Yovanovitch
618,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"That’s a hard question because one can always use additional funding. That said, I think that the Congress has been very generous in voting for security assistance and other forms of assistance for Ukraine.",46:29,Yovanovitch
619,Section_2,S. Castor,I see my time is coming to an end. Mr. Chairman?,46:48,Yovanovitch
620,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Thank the gentleman. We’ll now go to a number of five-minute rounds. I recognize myself for five minutes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, I want to follow up on some of the questions from my colleagues. Some of the early questions seem to suggest that your testimony here was completely irrelevant to the issues at hand. Why are you even here? Isn’t this just some small matter that should have been referred to HR?",46:54,Yovanovitch
621,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"So I want to bring our attention to someone who thought you were actually very important to this whole plot or scheme and that is the President of the United States. There was only one ambassador, I believe, who was discussed by the president and the July 25th call, and that was you, Ambassador Yovanovitch. I want to refer back to how you were brought up in that conversation.",47:18,Yovanovitch
622,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"At one point during the conversation, the president brings up this prosecutor who was very good and it was shut down, and that’s really unfair. I think you indicated earlier that that was a likely reference to Mr. Lutsenko, the prosecutor. Is that right?",47:41,Yovanovitch
623,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I believe that is the case, but I don’t know.",47:59,Yovanovitch
624,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"So immediately after the president brings up this corrupt former prosecutor, only one … I’m sorry, my staff has corrected me. Only one American ambassador is brought up in the call. Immediately after the president brings up this corrupt prosecutor that he praises and says he was treated very unfairly, he then encourages Zelensky to speak with Giuliani, the guy who orchestrated the smear campaign against you, correct?",48:02,Yovanovitch
625,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,48:28,Yovanovitch
626,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"And he then brings you up. So he praises the corrupt prosecutor. He says, “I want you to talk to Giuliani,” the guy who smeared you, and then he brings you up. He obviously thought you were relevant to this, but what is even more telling is immediately after he brings you up and says that you … “The woman was bad news.” He says, “There’s a lot to talk about about Biden’s son.” That Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.",48:30,Yovanovitch
627,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Immediately after praising this corrupt prosecutor he attacks you and then he goes right to Biden. That would indicate to you, wouldn’t it, Ambassador, that he connects you somehow with this prosecutor you are at odds with and his desire to see this investigation of Biden go forward, would it not?",49:15,Yovanovitch
628,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Again, you’re absolutely right that that is the thought progression.",49:39,Yovanovitch
629,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"My colleagues also asked in pushing you out of the way, ultimately Ambassador Taylor got appointed. Is Ambassador Taylor the kind of person that would further Giuliani’s aims? I think we can all agree that Ambassador Taylor is a remarkable public servant.",49:47,Yovanovitch
630,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Absolutely.,50:06,Yovanovitch
631,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"But what if the president could put someone else in place that wasn’t a career diplomat? What if he could put in place, say, a substantial donor to his inaugural? What if he could put in place someone with no diplomatic experience at all? What if he put in place someone whose portfolio doesn’t even include Ukraine? Might that person be willing to work with Rudy Giuliani in pursuit of these investigations?",50:07,Yovanovitch
632,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, maybe.",50:37,Yovanovitch
633,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"That’s exactly what happened, wasn’t it?",50:38,Yovanovitch
634,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,50:45,Yovanovitch
635,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"And my colleagues also say, “Well, the security assistance ultimately went through,” so if they sought to condition or bribe Ukraine into doing these investigations by withholding security assistance, they ultimately paid them money. Are you aware, Ambassador, that the security systems was not released until after a whistleblower complaint made its way to the white house?",50:45,Yovanovitch
636,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, I’m aware of that.",51:12,Yovanovitch
637,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Are you aware that it was not released until Congress announced it was doing an investigation?,51:15,Yovanovitch
638,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, I’m aware of that.",51:19,Yovanovitch
639,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"And finally, I want to ask you about the call record that my colleague read at the outset. I’m curious about this, and just for people watching at home so they’re not confused, there are two calls here. There’s the perfunctory congratulatory call after Zelensky is inaugurated, which my ranking member read this morning. And then there’s, of course, the very problematic call in July.",51:26,Yovanovitch
640,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Mm-hmm (affirmative).,51:49,Yovanovitch
641,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"One of the reasons we are here is what happened between April and July. But there was a readout put out by the White House at the time the April congratulatory call was made, and the White House readout said that the president discussed with Zelensky helping Ukraine root out corruption. Now, that, in fact, doesn’t appear anywhere in that call. So I want to ask you Ambassador, why would the White House put out an inaccurate reading? Why would the White House represent that the president said something about corruption when he said nothing about corruption in that call or, in fact, in the one in July?",51:50,Yovanovitch
642,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I can’t answer that question. I don’t have visibility into that.,52:35,Yovanovitch
643,Section_2,Adam Schiff,I thank you. Five minutes now to recognize the ranking member.,52:39,Yovanovitch
644,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Just to remind the gentlemen, there’s actually three calls. There’s the two calls with President Trump and the one that you reiterated in our last hearing a couple of weeks ago. Ambassador, I just want to clarify something before I yield. Are you against political appointed ambassadors? Is it not the president’s prerogative to appoint whoever he wants in any country?",52:48,Yovanovitch
645,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"First of all, I am not against political ambassadors, just to be clear.",53:09,Yovanovitch
646,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"I just wanted to clear that up. Now, can I yield to Ms. Stefanik? Do I need your permission?",53:12,Yovanovitch
647,Section_2,Adam Schiff,You may yield. Ms. Stefanik.,53:19,Yovanovitch
648,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"Thank you. Ambassador, before I was interrupted, I wanted to thank you for your 30 years of public service from Mogadishu to Ottawa, to Moscow, to London, to Kyiv. I also wanted to thank you for hosting the numerous bi-partisan delegations. I led one of those delegations in Ukraine. My questions today will focus on three key themes. The first is the role of the president when it comes to appointing our ambassadors. The second is longstanding corruption in Ukraine and the third is aid to Ukraine.",53:21,Yovanovitch
649,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"Earlier this week, as you know, we heard from George Kent and I know that Mr. Kent is a colleague, a friend, and someone who you deeply respect. In his testimony, he stated all ambassadors serve the pleasure of the president. You would agree with that statement, correct?",53:49,Yovanovitch
650,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,54:04,Yovanovitch
651,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"And in fact, he elaborated and went on to emphasize that this is without question. Everybody understands that. You would agree with that?",54:04,Yovanovitch
652,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I would agree with that.,54:12,Yovanovitch
653,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"And in your own deposition under oath, you stated quote, “Although I understand, everyone understands that I serve at the pleasure of the president,” is that correct?",54:13,Yovanovitch
654,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,54:22,Yovanovitch
655,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"And just so there’s no public confusion, you are still an employee of the State Department, correct?",54:23,Yovanovitch
656,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,54:29,Yovanovitch
657,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"And in the deposition, you say that you personally asked whether it would be possible to be a fellow at Georgetown University and, “That was arranged for me and I’m very grateful.” That’s where you’re posted today, correct?",54:30,Yovanovitch
658,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,54:42,Yovanovitch
659,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"Georgetown students are lucky to have you. We’re lucky to have you in foreign service, and I again want to thank you for your tremendous public service.",54:43,Yovanovitch
660,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"Shifting gears to corruption in Ukraine. In your powerful deposition, you described quote, “We have long understood that strong anti-corruption efforts must form an essential part of our policy in Ukraine and now there is a window of opportunity to do that. And so why is this important and why is this important to us? Put simply anti-corruption efforts serve Ukraine’s interest, but they also serve ours as well.” Is that still your testimony?",54:50,Yovanovitch
661,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,55:15,Yovanovitch
662,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"And particularly at the critical time in 2014, after the Ukrainian elections, you testified that the Ukrainian people had made clear in that very election that they were done with corruption, correct?",55:16,Yovanovitch
663,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,55:28,Yovanovitch
664,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"And you also testified that the Ukrainians thought it would be a good idea to set up this architecture of a special investigative office that would be all about the crimes of corruption, correct?",55:28,Yovanovitch
665,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,55:39,Yovanovitch
666,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"And I know this was before you arrived in Ukraine, but you are aware that the first case that the US, UK, and Ukraine investigators worked on was in fact against the owner of Burisma?",55:40,Yovanovitch
667,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,55:52,Yovanovitch
668,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,And that was during the Obama administration?,55:52,Yovanovitch
669,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,55:55,Yovanovitch
670,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"And in your testimony, and you said today, the investigation was never formally closed because quote, “It’s frankly useful to keep that company hanging on a hook. Right?” That’s your quote.",55:56,Yovanovitch
671,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah. The Ukrainian investigation was never-,56:06,Yovanovitch
672,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,Partnered with the US and the UK?,56:08,Yovanovitch
673,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"As I understand it. Yeah. Although, because we didn’t see the Ukrainians moving forward on that, we no longer partner with them on that case or in that way.",56:09,Yovanovitch
674,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"But let’s take a step back. The first time you personally became aware of Burisma was actually when you were being prepared by the Obama State Department for your Senate confirmation hearings. And this was in the form of practice questions and answers. This was your deposition and you testified that in this particular practice Q&A with the Obama State Department it wasn’t just generally about Burisma and corruption, it was specifically about Hunter Biden and Burisma. Is that correct?",56:18,Yovanovitch
675,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, it is.",56:47,Yovanovitch
676,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"And the exact quote from your testimony, Ambassador, is quote, “The way the question was phrased in this model Q&A was, ‘What can you tell us about Hunter Biden’s being named to the board of Burisma?'”",56:49,Yovanovitch
677,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"So for the millions of Americans watching, President Obama’s own State Department was so concerned about potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma that they raised it themselves while prepping this wonderful ambassador nominee before her confirmation. And yet, our democratic colleagues and the chairman of this committee cry foul when we dare ask that same question that the Obama State Department was so concerned about. But we will continue asking it. And lastly, in my 20 seconds left, I just want to get it on record, in terms of defensive lethal aid, which you were an advocate for, that was not provided by President Obama. It was provided by President Trump?",57:01,Yovanovitch
678,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s correct.,57:41,Yovanovitch
679,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,I yield back five seconds.,57:41,Yovanovitch
680,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Himes, you’re recognized.",57:44,Yovanovitch
681,Section_2,Jim Himes,"Ambassador, thank you for your testimony today. Those of us who sit up here are supposed to be dispassionate and judicial and measured, but I’m angry and I’ve been angry since I learned about your summary, an unexplained dismissal after a lifetime of excellent and faithful service to this country. I’m angry that a woman whose family fled communism and Nazi-ism who served this country beautifully for 33 years, not in Paris or in Rome, but literally under fire in places like Mogadishu and Kyiv. I’m angry that a woman like you would be not just dismissed but humiliated and attacked by the president of the United States. I’m not just angry for you. I’m angry for every single foreign service officer, for every single military officer, for every intelligence officer who right now might believe that a lifetime of service and sacrifice and excellent might be ignored by the president of the United States, or worse yet, attacked in language that would embarrass a mob boss.",57:47,Yovanovitch
682,Section_2,Jim Himes,"Now it’s the president’s defense and it’s emerging from my Republican colleagues today that this is all okay because as the president so memorably put it in his tweet this morning, it is a US president’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors. I’m a little troubled by this idea of an absolute right because that doesn’t feel to me like the system of government we have here. I think that how and why we exercise our powers and rights matters. Ambassador, when you’re ambassador somewhere, do you have the right to ask the intelligence community, the CIA in an embassy what operations they’re doing?",58:56,Yovanovitch
683,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"We talk about these things collaboratively. There’s some things that … In short, yes.",59:41,Yovanovitch
684,Section_2,Jim Himes,So you have the right to ask the intelligence community in your embassy what they’re doing. Why might you do that?,59:48,Yovanovitch
685,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Because sometimes operations have political consequences.,59:55,Yovanovitch
686,Section_2,Jim Himes,"Right, so the performance of your duties in the interests of the United States gives you the right to ask very sensitive questions of our intelligence community in your embassy. But what if instead of working through the issues that you just described, you went to dinner that night and handed over that information to a Russian agent for $10,000. Would that be an appropriate exercise of your right?",01:00:02,Yovanovitch
687,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, it would not.",01:00:30,Yovanovitch
688,Section_2,Jim Himes,It would not. And what would happen to you if you did that?,01:00:31,Yovanovitch
689,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I can’t even begin to imagine, but I would imagine that I would be pulled out of post.",01:00:33,Yovanovitch
690,Section_2,Jim Himes,"Right. And this is not about ambassadors, right? A police officer has the right to pull you over. But if the police officer pulls over his ex-wife because he’s angry, that’s probably not right. I have the right … In fact, today I cast a bunch of votes, but if I cast those vote, not in the interest of my constituents but because somebody bribed me, that is a severe abuse of my power. Wouldn’t you agree?",01:00:40,Yovanovitch
691,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:01:05,Yovanovitch
692,Section_2,Jim Himes,"So I guess the question is why after an exemplary performance as ambassador to Ukraine did the president decide that you should be removed? Because I think we just agreed that if that was not done in the national interest, that’s a problem. Ambassador, if you had remained ambassador to Ukraine, would you have recommended to the president of the United States that he asked the new Ukrainian president to investigate, and I’m quoting from the transcript here, CrowdStrike or the server?",01:01:07,Yovanovitch
693,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, I would repeat once again that the US intelligence community has concluded that it was the Russians.",01:01:49,Yovanovitch
694,Section_2,Jim Himes,"Okay. So ambassador, if you had remained as ambassador and not been summarily dismissed, would you have supported a three-month delay in congressionally mandated military aid to Ukraine?",01:01:55,Yovanovitch
695,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:02:11,Yovanovitch
696,Section_2,Jim Himes,"Ambassador, if you had remained as ambassador of Ukraine, would you have recommended to the president that he asked a new president of Ukraine to quote, “Find out about Biden’s son”?",01:02:11,Yovanovitch
697,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:02:27,Yovanovitch
698,Section_2,Jim Himes,I have no more questions. I yield back to balance my time.,01:02:30,Yovanovitch
699,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Mr. Conaway.,01:02:35,Yovanovitch
700,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, [inaudible 01:02:37] consent to enter the record. Dear Colleague, letter from Speaker Pelosi dated September 23rd. Relevant part reads, “We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate intelligence committees as required by law.”",01:02:36,Yovanovitch
701,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Without objection.,01:02:51,Yovanovitch
702,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Thank you. I look forward to you honoring that statement from the speaker. Turning this to the ambassador. Ambassador, I, for one, want to thank you so very much for a long service, exemplary service to our country and on behalf of our nation. [inaudible 01:03:07] said about what was going on around the phone call. I’d like to focus more on what’s happened since then to you and your career and what’s going on.",01:02:52,Yovanovitch
703,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"So when you got the word … Anytime a ambassador changes post there’s a process you go through to depict what you do next, and that happened in this instance. Can you give us a quick statement as to how … what happened when you came back here as to what your next assignment would be at the state?",01:03:16,Yovanovitch
704,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"So when I came back, obviously, it was sort of out of cycle. There was nothing set up.",01:03:33,Yovanovitch
705,Section_2,Mike Conaway,Sure.,01:03:39,Yovanovitch
706,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"And again, I am grateful that Deputy Secretary Sullivan asked me what I would like to do next. I recall that there was the fellowship at Georgetown and asked whether that might be something that could be arranged.",01:03:40,Yovanovitch
707,Section_2,Mike Conaway,Was that your only choice?,01:03:53,Yovanovitch
708,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I’m not sure. We didn’t really discuss other options.,01:03:56,Yovanovitch
709,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Last [inaudible 01:03:59] Georgetown is fertile ground for State Department recruitment, a future fledgling for service officers, and so they now benefit from your experience and your inspiration to inspire them to spend their professional life in service to our nation.",01:03:59,Yovanovitch
710,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thank you.,01:04:14,Yovanovitch
711,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"You’re a fellow there, you teach classes. How many classes are you teaching?",01:04:14,Yovanovitch
712,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, this semester I was supposed to teach two. I am still teaching one on national security. The other one was on Ukraine and I asked whether I could postpone that.",01:04:18,Yovanovitch
713,Section_2,Mike Conaway,Defer on that.,01:04:29,Yovanovitch
714,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,[crosstalk 01:04:30] appropriate.,01:04:30,Yovanovitch
715,Section_2,Mike Conaway,How many students in your class? Approximately.,01:04:30,Yovanovitch
716,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"There are, let’s see, I think 14. 14, 15.",01:04:33,Yovanovitch
717,Section_2,Mike Conaway,All right. Any other responsibilities to the state other than the fellowship at Georgetown?,01:04:36,Yovanovitch
718,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I will tell you that all of this has kept me very busy.",01:04:42,Yovanovitch
719,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Okay, I got that. But no necessarily day-to-day things that you’d be responsible for?",01:04:48,Yovanovitch
720,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:04:52,Yovanovitch
721,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Other than not qualifying for overseas stipends and other things, has your compensation been affected by being recalled the way you were?",01:04:54,Yovanovitch
722,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, it has not.",01:05:00,Yovanovitch
723,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Okay. I’m worried about the way you might be treated by your fellow employees of the state. Any negative … Do they hold you in less high regard than they used to as a result of this? Do they shun you at the lunch counter? I mean, did they treat you badly as a result of the way you were treated by the president?",01:05:01,Yovanovitch
724,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I’ve actually received an outpouring of support from my colleagues,01:05:23,Yovanovitch
725,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Okay, so the folks that you respect the most still respect you and appear to hold you in high regard and high affection?",01:05:26,Yovanovitch
726,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,They do.,01:05:33,Yovanovitch
727,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Okay. George Kent was in here a couple of days ago. He made some exemplary statements about you, really glowing. All of us, I think, would like to be the recipient of something that worthy, and I believe you are as well. Any reason on earth that you can think of that George Kent would be saying that because of some reason other than the fact that he believes it in his heart of hearts?",01:05:34,Yovanovitch
728,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Like what?,01:05:55,Yovanovitch
729,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"Well, I mean, like somebody paid him to do it.",01:05:56,Yovanovitch
730,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Oh, no. Absolutely not.",01:05:58,Yovanovitch
731,Section_2,Mike Conaway,"So you and I agree that we think he was sincere in that bragging on you, and that’s all post recall episode that was very much in the discussion this morning. Well, I’m glad that your colleagues … I would have expected nothing … any different from your colleagues at state to continue to treat you with the high regard that you’ve earned over all these years of great service. I hope that whatever you decide to do after the Georgetown fellowship, that you’re as successful there as you’ve been in the first 33 years. With that, I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Jordan.",01:06:00,Yovanovitch
732,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"I have a unanimous consent request that an article entitled Whistleblower is Expected to Testify Soon, House Intelligent Chairman Schiff Says, Wall Street Journal, September 29, 2019, be included in the record",01:06:28,Yovanovitch

744,Section_2,Terri Sewell,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador, in your prior testimony, you spoke so movingly about your family background. You stated that your parents fled communists and Nazi regimes and that they valued-",01:07:49,Yovanovitch
745,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"… And Nazi regimes, and that they valued freedom and democracy offered in America. Having experienced totalitarian regimes, did that have any effect on your desire to enter into the United States foreign service?",01:08:03,Yovanovitch
746,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, it did.",01:08:17,Yovanovitch
747,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"Did you always know that you want it to be in the foreign service? I look at your background, and it is perfectly suited for what you’re doing. I note that you studied at the [Pushkin 01:08:32] State Russian Language Institute in Russia to learn Russian.",01:08:19,Yovanovitch
748,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah.,01:08:36,Yovanovitch
749,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,Do you also have an MS from the National Defense University National War College?,01:08:37,Yovanovitch
750,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:08:44,Yovanovitch
751,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"I even noticed that you earned your undergraduate degree in history in Russian studies in college, and coincidentally, that was also my college, and you definitely are doing Princeton in the nation service by what you do every day. But I really want to know how it felt to have your reputation sullied, not for state and nation, but for personal gain. You spoke about how your service is not just your own personal service. It affects your family. And today we’ve seen you as this former ambassador, this 33 year veteran of the foreign service, but I want to know about you personally, and how this has affected you personally and your family.",01:08:45,Yovanovitch
752,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah. It’s been a difficult time. I’m a private person. I don’t want to put all that out there, but it’s been a very, very difficult time because the President does have the right to have his own or her own ambassador in every country in the world.",01:09:38,Yovanovitch
753,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"But does a president have the right to actually malign people’s character? It may not be against any law, but I would think that it would be against decorum and decency.",01:09:56,Yovanovitch
754,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"There’s a question as to why the kind of campaign to get me out of Ukraine happened because all the President has to do is say he wants a different ambassador. And in my line of work, perhaps in your line of work as well, all we have is our reputation. And so this has been a very painful period.",01:10:08,Yovanovitch
755,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,How has it affected your family?,01:10:29,Yovanovitch
756,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I really don’t want to get into that, but thank you for asking.",01:10:33,Yovanovitch
757,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"Because I do care. I also want to know how you think it affected your fellow colleagues in the foreign service. My Republican colleagues have said that since you received such adulation and embracing from your own fellow colleagues, that what occurred, the incident that occurred with the President and his cronies maligning your reputation, has that had a chilling effect on the ability and the morale within the foreign service? Can you speak to that?",01:10:37,Yovanovitch
758,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah. I think that it has had exactly that, a chilling effect. Not only in Embassy Kiev, but throughout the State Department because people don’t know whether their efforts to pursue our stated policy are going to be supported, and that is a dangerous place to be.",01:11:08,Yovanovitch
759,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"Now, for the record, my Republican colleagues will probably try to paint you as a Never Trumper. Are you a Never Trumper?",01:11:40,Yovanovitch
760,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:11:47,Yovanovitch
761,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"As a foreign service officer, you took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States without regard for who’s in office. Is that correct?",01:11:47,Yovanovitch

763,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"ave you also served you in your 33 years for not just democratic presidents, but also Republican presidents?",01:11:57,Yovanovitch
764,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Four Republican presidents.,01:12:02,Yovanovitch
765,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"Four Republican presidents. In fact, you joined the foreign service under Reagan. Is that not right?",01:12:05,Yovanovitch
766,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s true.",01:12:09,Yovanovitch
767,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"Now, why do you think it’s really important that foreign service officers are nonpartisan? Can you talk to us about why it’s important for you to do your job and your fellow foreign of service officers to do your job that you’re nonpartisan?",01:12:10,Yovanovitch
768,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah. Because our work is essentially nonpartisan. And Senator Vandenberg, a Republican Senator who actually partnered with President Truman, coined a phrase that politics should stop at the water’s edge. And I think that’s exactly right because while obviously the competition of ideas in a democracy with different parties, different individuals is hugely important, but at the end of the day, when we are dealing with other countries, it needs to be about what is right for the United States. Those are our national security interests, and whether an individual works for the CIA or the military or the State Department, we’ve got to be nonpartisan and thinking about what is right for the United States.",01:12:23,Yovanovitch
769,Section_2,Rep. Sewell,"Well, on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say thank you for your service. I yield back the balance of my time.",01:13:14,Yovanovitch

771,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,Mr. Turner.,01:13:19,Yovanovitch
772,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"Ambassador, I want to tell you I have a great deal of respect for what you do. I serve on the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee. I’ve worked with the Native Parliamentary Assembly, including being its president and I know the complexity of of what you do. I know you have little access directly to decision makers, little resources, but you have still a great deal of responsibility. It’s a complex task, and I want to take us from just the concept of one dimensional Ukraine being corrupt to the other issues that you had to deal with as the Ukraine ambassador.",01:13:21,Yovanovitch
773,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"You had to deal with more than just our bilateral relationship with the Ukraine. For example, and I’d like confirmation that obviously I know you know these, but these were on portfolio. You had to deal with the issue of the OSCE Budapest agreement, and the denuclearization of Ukraine, and the issues of its territorial integrity of the signatories. Correct?",01:13:48,Yovanovitch
774,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Could you run that by me again?,01:14:11,Yovanovitch
775,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"The OSCE, the Organization for Security and Cooperation for Europe, and the Budapest agreement, under which Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons and believed they had its territorial integrity guaranteed by the United States and Russia. You would have had that in your portfolio.",01:14:12,Yovanovitch
776,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, that-",01:14:27,Yovanovitch
777,Section_2,Rep. Turner,… Was an issue you would have to do with Ukrainian zones.,01:14:28,Yovanovitch
778,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah. When the Ukrainians would ask about our policy and whether it was in keeping with the Budapest agreement.,01:14:30,Yovanovitch
779,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"Excellent. NATO. Ukraine is an aspiring NATO country, and of course, you have the Bucharest Summit, where the US and the NATO allies made a statement that they would get membership. That would have been on your portfolio. They would have been discussing with you their-",01:14:36,Yovanovitch
780,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes. Certainly aspirations to NATO membership would be-,01:14:49,Yovanovitch
781,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"And it’s also consistent with us policy that the US supports Ukraine joining the EU, and they have a great deal of interest and desire for joining the EU, correct?",01:14:52,Yovanovitch
782,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:15:02,Yovanovitch
783,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"And they just had a summit in Ukraine in July, where they talked about the associated agreement on economic integration between the Ukraines and the EU, and they also had a discussion about the illegal annexation of Crimea, and the blocking by Russia of the Ukrainian sailors that came out of the Azov Sea and that were captured. Those would have all been issues that would have been in your portfolio, and that were consistent with what the EU’s issues are, correct?",01:15:03,Yovanovitch
784,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes. We work closely with our EU partners.,01:15:27,Yovanovitch
785,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"In addition to Ukraine, you’d have to work with France and UK and Germany, all of which who have different ideas of those. The ambassadors to the Ukraine, of France, Germany, and … Correct?",01:15:29,Yovanovitch
786,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah. Yeah. Did you say they all have different ideas about these issues?,01:15:39,Yovanovitch
787,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"Some of them, yes.",01:15:42,Yovanovitch
788,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,But mostly there’s a consensus.,01:15:44,Yovanovitch
789,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"You’d have to work with NGOs, non-governmental organizations, on issues that we heard about: legal aid, human trafficking, building democratic institutions. And even HIV/AIDS, right?",01:15:46,Yovanovitch
790,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:15:55,Yovanovitch
791,Section_2,Rep. Turner,And you’ve spoken at several NGOs while you were the ambassador to Ukraine.,01:15:56,Yovanovitch
792,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:15:59,Yovanovitch
793,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"Now, the US ambassador to the EU, they would have under their portfolio aspiring nations to the EU, would they not?",01:16:00,Yovanovitch
794,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah.,01:16:10,Yovanovitch
795,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"Okay, so EU Ambassador Sondland then would’ve had Ukraine in his portfolio because they’re an aspiring nation and he’s our ambassador to the EU, correct?",01:16:10,Yovanovitch
796,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I think he testified that one of his first [crosstalk 01:16:22]-,01:16:20,Yovanovitch
797,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"But you agree that it’s within his portfolio, correct?",01:16:22,Yovanovitch
798,Section_2,Speaker 1,She was answering the question.,01:16:25,Yovanovitch
799,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"You would agree that’s in his portfolio, would you not? Yes.",01:16:26,Yovanovitch
800,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I would agree that-,01:16:30,Yovanovitch
801,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"Yes. Thank you. Now, I want to go to the next one-",01:16:31,Yovanovitch
802,Section_2,Speaker 1,"I’m sorry. Could she finish her answer, please?",01:16:33,Yovanovitch
803,Section_2,Rep. Turner,… because I’m about out of time.,01:16:35,Yovanovitch
804,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,The gentleman will suspend.,01:16:35,Yovanovitch
805,Section_2,Rep. Turner,Holbrooke is a gentleman who have an great deal of reverence for-,01:16:35,Yovanovitch
806,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,"The gentleman will suspend. Ambassador Yovanovitch had not finished her answer. You may finish your answer, Ambassador.",01:16:39,Yovanovitch
807,Section_2,Rep. Turner,Not on my time. You’re done.,01:16:44,Yovanovitch
808,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,Nope. Ambassador. Ambassador will be recognized.,01:16:45,Yovanovitch
809,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I would say that all EU ambassadors deal with other countries, including aspiring countries, but it is unusual to name the US ambassador to the EU to be responsible for all aspects of Ukraine.",01:16:49,Yovanovitch
810,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"I’ll take your additional answer. It’s still in his portfolio, which was my question. You knew of Ambassador Holbrooke probably? I did. He’s a man of great integrity. One of our most successful ambassadors. You know him probably by his reputation. You would agree that he was a man of great reputation, right?",01:17:06,Yovanovitch
811,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:17:21,Yovanovitch
812,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"Yes. Madam Ambassador, would it surprise you if in 2004 John Kerry had a member of his campaign who was a foreign policy advisor who traveled to the Ukraine in July and met with Ukrainian officials and the US ambassador. Would that surprise you? A member of John Kerry’s campaign team for President of the United States in 2004 traveled to Ukraine, met with the US ambassador in July.",01:17:21,Yovanovitch
813,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Not necessarily. What was the context?,01:17:49,Yovanovitch
814,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"Would you have taken that meeting? If a member of John Kerry’s campaign traveled to the Ukraine, would you have taken that meeting?",01:17:51,Yovanovitch
815,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I guess it would depend on what the purpose of the meeting was.,01:18:05,Yovanovitch
816,Section_2,Rep. Turner,"Well, that meeting actually occurred, and it was with John Holbrooke. John Holbrooke was a private citizen, traveled to Ukraine, met with the US ambassadors, met with Ukrainian officials. He was also there about HIV/AIDS, which was in addition to something that The Clinton Foundation was working on. So we have a official of the John Kerry campaign 2004 as a private citizen meeting with our Ambassador in Ukraine.",01:18:06,Yovanovitch
817,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,The time of the gentleman has expired.,01:18:27,Yovanovitch
818,Section_2,Rep. Turner,Is that unusual?,01:18:28,Yovanovitch
819,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,We meet with private individuals all the time.,01:18:30,Yovanovitch
820,Section_2,Rep. Turner,It probably wasn’t unusual for Giuliani to be there-,01:18:32,Yovanovitch
821,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,"The gentleman’s time has expired. Mr. Carson, you’re recognized.",01:18:33,Yovanovitch
822,Section_2,Rep. Carson,"Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Madam Ambassador. Madam Ambassador, returning to the topic of corruption, we heard evidence that you were successful at promoting efforts to address corruption. On Wednesday, in testifying about your very sterling career as a champion of anti corruption efforts in Ukraine, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent said, quote, “You can’t promote principled anti corruption action without pissing off corrupt people,” end quote.",01:18:38,Yovanovitch
823,Section_2,Rep. Carson,"It seems that your efforts as ambassador to essentially reform the powerful Prosecutor General’s office in Ukraine did exactly that. Madam Ambassador, what concerned you about the Prosecutor General’s office when you are the ambassador in Ukraine?",01:19:04,Yovanovitch
824,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"What concerned us was that there didn’t seem to be any progress in the three overall objectives that Mr. Lutsenko had laid out, most importantly for the Ukrainian people, but also the international community. So the first thing was reforming the Prosecutor General’s office. It’s a tremendously powerful office where they had authority not only to conduct investigations, so an FBI-like a function, but also to do the actual prosecution. So very, very wide powers, which is part of that Soviet legacy.",01:19:20,Yovanovitch
825,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"And there just wasn’t a lot of progress in that. There wasn’t a lot of progress in handling personnel issues, and how the structure should be organized, and who should have the important jobs, because some of the people in those jobs or were considered to be corrupt themselves.",01:19:56,Yovanovitch
826,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Secondly, the issue that was tremendously important to the Ukrainian people of bringing justice to the over 100 people who died on the maidan during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. Nobody has been held accountable for that, and that is an open wound for the Ukrainian people.",01:20:22,Yovanovitch
827,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"And thirdly, Ukraine needs all the money that it has. And there is a strong belief that former President Yanukovych and those around him made off with over $40 billion. $40 billion. That’s a lot in the US. It’s a huge amount of money in Ukraine. And so, again, I think maybe $1 billion was repatriated, but the rest of it is still missing.",01:20:41,Yovanovitch
828,Section_2,Rep. Carson,"Madam Ambassador, was the head of that office corrupt?",01:21:16,Yovanovitch
829,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,We believe so.,01:21:20,Yovanovitch
830,Section_2,Rep. Carson,"And you got the sense, did you not, that he was a driving force behind some of the attacks against you?",01:21:20,Yovanovitch
831,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I did.,01:21:27,Yovanovitch
832,Section_2,Rep. Carson,"Which ultimately led to your removal, correct?",01:21:29,Yovanovitch
833,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:21:32,Yovanovitch
834,Section_2,Rep. Carson,"But it wasn’t just him. His allegations were picked up and spread by Mr. Giuliani, and Donald Trump, Jr., were they not?",01:21:32,Yovanovitch
835,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:21:40,Yovanovitch
836,Section_2,Rep. Carson,"So let me get this straight. You were effective at fighting corruption in the Ukraine, fighting that corruption was important to the national security of the United States, and you were punished for that, ultimately being removed from your post by the President of the United States. So in your opinion, Madam Ambassador, why is it important to have a nonpartisan career in the foreign services?",01:21:41,Yovanovitch
837,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think it’s important to have a nonpartisan career service because what we do is inherently nonpartisan. It is about our national security interests. It’s not about what is good for a particular party at a particular time. It has to be about the greater interests of our security in, frankly, what is an increasingly dangerous world.",01:22:07,Yovanovitch
838,Section_2,Rep. Carson,"And could you briefly describe for us what broad US policies you have sought to advance in your 33 years of service, and specifically in post-Soviet states like Ukraine?",01:22:37,Yovanovitch
839,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, that’s a broad question, but I think that certainly in my time in Russia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, all of these countries are very different, as is Ukraine. But I think that establishing positive, constructive relations to the extent that we can with those countries is really important. There are three basic areas. One is security, the second is economic, and third is political. And so working all the sub issues, your colleague mentioned many of them, we certainly did that in Ukraine as well.",01:22:48,Yovanovitch
840,Section_2,Rep. Carson,Thank you for your service. I yield to the Chairman.,01:23:30,Yovanovitch
841,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thanks.,01:23:32,Yovanovitch
842,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,Dr. Wenstrup.,01:23:34,Yovanovitch
843,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Ambassador, thank you very much for being here, and I just want to start by saying I appreciate your years of service and enduring years of moving around the world to dangerous places. And hearing from you today, I realized that we share some of the same feelings and experiences.",01:23:35,Yovanovitch
844,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"As an army reserve surgeon, I received a call on a Monday afternoon in March of 2005 that told me I was being deployed to Iraq and I had to be out the door in the next two to three days. I had patients scheduled for months. I had surgeries scheduled and had to get … So I understand that shocking feeling that can come with some abrupt change like that. And I was at processing a few days later, and I was told my orders would say you’re going for 18 months, but it may be a little shorter than that.",01:23:54,Yovanovitch
845,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"But I served a year in Iraq, 2005, 2006. One of the bloodiest times of the war, and this is where I have another personal relationship with what you were talking about. I saw a nation in Iraq of people that craved a non-corrupt government, and sadly today, even though it helped to remove Saddam Hussein, they still have corruption concerns in Iraq, and I can relate to what you said just a few moments ago that it feels like an open wound when it hasn’t been resolved.",01:24:27,Yovanovitch
846,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"But you might imagine with that military experience and background, I take an interest in military strategy and capabilities, and the thoughts of those with boots on the ground, like you and Mr. Volker, and Mr. Taylor. In your deposition on page 144, you’re quoted as saying “In terms of lethal assistance, we all felt it was very significant that this administration made the decision to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine.” Just real quick, who in general makes up ‘we all?’ Would that be the team I mentioned?",01:24:56,Yovanovitch
847,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah. Can I just look at that? Just one sec.,01:25:25,Yovanovitch
848,Section_2,Speaker 2,Ask him for the line.,01:25:32,Yovanovitch
849,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,What line is that?,01:25:33,Yovanovitch
850,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"Well, I have to move on. You said “We all felt it was very significant that this administration made the decision to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine.” I assume that as those that have boots on the ground, and then ‘this administration,’ I assume you meant the Trump Administration.",01:25:34,Yovanovitch
851,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:25:52,Yovanovitch
852,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"Yeah, okay. In your deposition also on page 144, you spoke about the generosity of Congress. You mentioned it today. Increasing aid to Ukraine. And part of your deposition after that statement that I quoted before you asked, did you advocate for that? You responded yes. And then you were asked, “Did you advocate for that prior to the new administration in 2016,” and you responded “Well, yeah.” On page 148, the question was “Were you satisfied that the administration was doing what was necessary to support Ukraine?” You said, “In what respect?” And they said in, “In, you know, helping them deter Russian aggression, helping them with foreign aid and foreign assistance,” and you said, “Yeah.”",01:25:52,Yovanovitch
853,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"And I agree that that lethal assistance was very significant, as you said. And I thank you for that. And I thank Mr. Volker, and I thank Mr. Taylor.",01:26:35,Yovanovitch
854,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"Acting Ambassador Taylor was here Wednesday. He testified about the President’s decision to withhold lethal aid, and he said the President felt it might provoke Russia. And Mr. Taylor contested then that Russia has already been provoked, and they have invaded the Ukraine. President Obama had the right to make his own foreign policy and make his own decisions as President of the United States, correct?",01:26:49,Yovanovitch
855,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah. There’s an inter agency process, and obviously Congress has a role as well.",01:27:15,Yovanovitch
856,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"But he has the right as President … I respect the inter-agency process. I’m getting to that actually. But he has the right to make his own foreign policy and make his own decisions as President of the United States, as do all presidents, correct?",01:27:19,Yovanovitch
857,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:27:32,Yovanovitch
858,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"So we have one president, Obama, who denied lethal aid altogether in spite of ambassadors and other boots on the ground recommending, making that recommendation, such as you did. We have another president, Trump, who vetted those that were going to receive the aid, and provided it consistent with your inter agency recommendations, and that of your colleagues. Let me just ask you, from a military standpoint, without Javelins, would you agree the Russians had much greater military offensive options and flexibility in their effort to attack the Ukraine without the Ukraine having Javelins?",01:27:33,Yovanovitch
859,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah. They had another option. Although the tank war is no longer the war that is being fought in Ukraine.,01:28:23,Yovanovitch
860,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,But I’m just saying with the Javelin-,01:28:30,Yovanovitch
861,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, it’s another option.",01:28:32,Yovanovitch
862,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"And there’s a reason for that, because the Javelins are there. And so I think that that changes the scenario, but I just wanted to make that point that the President has a right to have their own foreign policy, and to make their own decisions. And with that, I yield back.",01:28:32,Yovanovitch
863,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah. If I could just supplement one of my answers.,01:28:46,Yovanovitch
864,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,Of course.,01:28:50,Yovanovitch
865,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"So I want to thank you for your service as well, but what I’d like to say is while I obviously don’t dispute that the President has the right to withdraw an ambassador at any time for any reason, but what I do wonder is why it was necessary to smear my reputation.",01:28:50,Yovanovitch
866,Section_2,Rep. Wenstrup,"Well, I wasn’t asking you about that, but thank you very much, ma’am.",01:29:15,Yovanovitch
867,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,Representative Speer.,01:29:19,Yovanovitch
868,Section_2,Rep. Speer,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ambassador, so very much. You are confirmed by the Senate on a voice vote, weren’t you?",01:29:20,Yovanovitch
869,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:29:28,Yovanovitch
870,Section_2,Rep. Speer,"So unanimous, Republicans and Democrats, correct?",01:29:29,Yovanovitch
871,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:29:32,Yovanovitch
872,Section_2,Rep. Speer,"No dispute. You said that in summer of 2018, the smear campaign began in your testimony earlier today. Did Secretary Pompeo at any time come to your aid?",01:29:32,Yovanovitch
873,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, my understanding from Assistant Secretary Phil Reeker and Deputy Secretary Sullivan is that the rumors about me, for lack of a better word, the smear campaign, which was behind closed doors at that point, that there were a number of discussions between the President and Secretary Pompeo, and that he actually did keep me in place for as long as he could. That’s what I was told.",01:29:48,Yovanovitch
874,Section_2,Rep. Speer,"So it appears that back in 2018, the President was already making noises that he wanted you out of there. It appears that as early as April of 2018, Mr. Parnass was at a fundraiser for the President, and recommended that you be removed, and then subsequently in May of 2018 was pictured at a White House dinner with the President, and then later in May made a contribution of over $325,000 illegally to the President’s reelection campaign. Are you aware of that?",01:30:18,Yovanovitch
875,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I’m aware of the press about those things.,01:30:54,Yovanovitch
876,Section_2,Rep. Speer,Does that help you understand a little bit more why this smear campaign was under way?,01:30:58,Yovanovitch
877,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:31:07,Yovanovitch
878,Section_2,Rep. Speer,"All right. You made some very riveting comments in your statement this morning that I just want to repeat because I think we should have you expand on it. You said, “I’ve always understood that I served at the pleasure of the President. I still find it difficult to comprehend that foreign and private interests were able to undermine US interest in this way. Individuals who apparently felt stymied by our efforts to promote stated US policy against corruption, that is to do our mission, were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador using unofficial back channels.”",01:31:09,Yovanovitch
879,Section_2,Rep. Speer,"Now, as I listened to you make that statement, I was thinking of all the other persons in the foreign service who now have to be concerned that it’s not good enough to follow the stated US foreign policy, but also to be aware that maybe the President has a back channel of interests that he is promoting that is diametrically opposed to our stated foreign policy. Can you expand on that please?",01:31:55,Yovanovitch
880,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I think that it’s important that whoever is representing the President, an ambassador, speaks with the full authority of the President in our foreign policy establishment. And if there are others who are also helping with responsibilities in that country, for example, Ambassador Kurt Volker with his important mission to bring peace to the Donbass, that we all speak with one voice. That it’s all about our common security interest, and that it’s not about personal gain, or commercial gain, or anything else. That it’s about our national security.",01:32:24,Yovanovitch
881,Section_2,Rep. Speer,"But in this case, the Tres Amigos appeared to be more interested in getting an investigation than into promoting an anti corruption effort in Ukraine. Is that correct?",01:33:09,Yovanovitch
882,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That appears to be the case.,01:33:23,Yovanovitch
883,Section_2,Rep. Speer,"You were told at one point in 2019 in February, earlier this year, you spoke to a minister and Ukraine who warned that when it came to Rudy Giuliani, you needed to, quote, “Watch your back.” What did you understand him to mean?",01:33:28,Yovanovitch
884,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I didn’t exactly know, but the rumor was out there at that time, and in fact I think this minister also shared that information with me, that the Mayor was working to have me removed.",01:33:44,Yovanovitch
885,Section_2,Rep. Speer,"Let me just say to conclude that you have endured an orchestrated character assassination, that it was hatched over a year and a half ago, and that it’s laced with enormous campaign contributions to the President’s reelection campaign. And you deserve more from the American people, and you deserve more from Congress in supporting you. I yield back.",01:33:59,Yovanovitch
886,Section_2,Speaker 3,I have a unanimous consent.,01:34:23,Yovanovitch
887,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,"Mr. Stewart, you’re recognized.",01:34:26,Yovanovitch
888,Section_2,Speaker 3,"I have a unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman.",01:34:27,Yovanovitch
889,Section_2,Rep. Schiff,"We can take that up later. Mr. Stewart, you’re recognized.",01:34:29,Yovanovitch
890,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman and others. Ambassador, thank you for being with us here today. Welcome, as I said a couple of days ago, to the witnesses. Welcome to year four of the impeachment proceedings. I’m sorry that you’ve gotten drugged into this.",01:34:36,Yovanovitch
891,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,"For three years, we’ve heard these outrageous and frankly unbelievable accusations regarding Russian collusion, accusations that we now know are absolute nonsense, that there was no basis at all despite promises from some members of this committee that they had secret proof that would prove this collusion. And, granted, we know that it was nonsense. But now in year four, we apparently move on to the Ukraine and quid pro quo, culminating yesterday when The Speaker announced that the President would indeed be impeached and removed for office for bribery. And with that statement, I would now feel compelled to ask you, Madam Ambassador, as you sit here before us, very simply and directly, do you have any information regarding the President of the United States accepting any bribes?",01:34:50,Yovanovitch
892,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:35:43,Yovanovitch
893,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the President of the United States has been involved with at all?,01:35:44,Yovanovitch
894,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:35:53,Yovanovitch
895,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,"Thank you. Thank you for answering that directly. The American people know this is nonsense. The American people know this is unfair, and I have a prediction regarding this. I think that public support for impeachment is actually going to be less when these hearings are over than it is when the hearings began because finally the American people are going to be able to see the evidence, and they’re going to be able to make their own determination regarding that.",01:35:54,Yovanovitch
896,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,"Now, I want to ask you one thing very quickly, and you’ve been asked this again and again, but my question is slightly different. You’ve been asked as you recognize that the President, any president, has the ability to ask his ambassadors to serve at-will. I’m curious, do you think that’s the right policy?",01:36:19,Yovanovitch
897,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, I probably think it is.",01:36:40,Yovanovitch
898,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,"I do as well. It may be imperfect. There may be times when it’s not used perfectly, but I agree with you. It is the right policy. I don’t think that we should change that.",01:36:41,Yovanovitch
899,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,"Now, I’d like to read from some previous statements, including one of your own as well as others, regarding the appropriateness of investigating corruption in the UK. From Miss Fiona Hill: “So again, the fact that there are investigations into corruption in the energy sector in Ukraine as well as in Russia and many other countries is not a surprise.”",01:36:53,Yovanovitch
900,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,"From yourself, your previous testimony: “Question, was it the general understanding that Burisma was a company that suffered from allegations of corruption?” Your answer was “Yes.”",01:37:11,Yovanovitch
901,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,From Ambassador Sondland: “I just am generally aware that Burisma is considered a potentially corrupt company.” Would you agree then that it’s appropriate to investigate corruption?,01:37:21,Yovanovitch
902,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think it’s appropriate if it’s part of our national strategy. What I would say is that we have a process for doing that. It’s called the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. We have one with Ukraine, and generally it goes from our Department of Justice to the Ministry of Justice in the country of interest.",01:37:39,Yovanovitch
903,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,Okay.,01:38:01,Yovanovitch
904,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s the usual pattern.,01:38:01,Yovanovitch
905,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,"And I appreciate that. Regardless of the process though, it’s appropriate for us to investigate potential corruption, and especially … Look, we’re about to give some of these countries hundreds of millions of dollars. That the US taxpayer said, “Here’s a dollar of mine. Go ahead and give it to this other country, but please only do it if you know it’s not going to be used for corrupt purposes or against our national interest.”",01:38:02,Yovanovitch
906,Section_2,Rep. Stewart,"And I’ll conclude with this because I promised my friend, Mr. Jordan, I would save him a little bit of time. We mentioned earlier that the Vice President, when he went to the Ukraine and called for the specific firing of a specific prosecutor, that he was, as they say, completing official US policy. But the interesting thing is this, the Vice President had exactly two countries that were his responsibility at that time, China and the Ukraine. And he has bragged and been very proud of his influence in the previous administration. He says again and again that the Obama Administration listened to him, so it doesn’t surprise me that they would be fulfilling a policy that this Vice President certainly helped to formulate.",01:38:26,Yovanovitch

926,Section_2,Rep. Quigley,"You wanted to finish your extended tour, correct?",01:40:31,Yovanovitch
927,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I did.,01:40:35,Yovanovitch
928,Section_2,Rep. Quigley,What did you want to do after that? Did you know?,01:40:36,Yovanovitch
929,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I wasn’t sure.,01:40:40,Yovanovitch
930,Section_2,Rep. Quigley,"There’s nothing wrong with Georgetown. It’s a fine place, right?",01:40:43,Yovanovitch
931,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,It’s a wonderful place.,01:40:46,Yovanovitch
932,Section_2,Rep. Quigley,"But it’s the only choice at the end of a distinguished career, after all that. It’s not the end of a Hallmark movie. It’s the end of a really bad reality TV show brought to you by someone who knows a lot about that.",01:40:48,Yovanovitch
933,Section_2,Rep. Quigley,You previously testified that you sought advice from Ambassador Sondland at this time about what to do. Is that correct?,01:41:10,Yovanovitch
934,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I did.,01:41:19,Yovanovitch
935,Section_2,Rep. Quigley,Why did you reach out to the Ambassador?,01:41:20,Yovanovitch
936,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Because this was clearly so political and the State Department was not in a position, shall we say, to manage the issue, it didn’t appear to me. And so I asked Ambassador Sondland. He was a political appointee. He said he was close to the President. And so he had just been in Ukraine for a ship visit with some of his EU colleagues from Brussels, and so I reached out to him for advice. When this-",01:41:24,Yovanovitch
937,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"… and so I reached out to him for advice. When this was no longer a Ukraine kind of an interview with Mr. Lutsenko, kind of a Ukrainian, but it became sort of the American politicians and pundits, et cetera were repeating those allegations, I asked him for advice.",01:42:03,Yovanovitch
938,Section_2,Mike Quigley,"And it meant a lot to you. This is an extraordinary time and the advice meant a lot, and what was his advice?",01:42:23,Yovanovitch
939,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, he suggested that I needed to go big or go home, and he said that the best thing to do would be to send out a tweet, praise the President, that sort of thing.",01:42:32,Yovanovitch
940,Section_2,Mike Quigley,And what was your reaction to that advice?,01:42:51,Yovanovitch
941,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, my reaction was that I’m sure he meant well, but it was not advice that I could really follow. It felt partisan, it felt political, and that was not something that I thought was in keeping with my role as Ambassador and a foreign service officer.",01:42:55,Yovanovitch
942,Section_2,Mike Quigley,"Did he give you any specific suggestions on what to say about the President of the United States, or just say something nice about him?",01:43:21,Yovanovitch
943,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah, just to praise him.",01:43:28,Yovanovitch
944,Section_2,Mike Quigley,Thank you. I yield the balance to the Chairman.,01:43:31,Yovanovitch
945,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"I want to follow up on Mr. Quigley’s line of question, and also harken back to something you were asked by minority council earlier. You were asked a couple of questions. Do you think you could have done more to push back against this smear campaign? And I’m not suggesting this is what the council was getting at, but sometimes victims are asked, “Aren’t you responsible for your own victimization?” What would you say to people who say, “Isn’t it kind of your fault, Ambassador, that you didn’t fight your own smear harder?”",01:43:34,Yovanovitch
946,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I think that … I’ve been a foreign service officer for a long time, and just like the military, we have our own culture, we have our own kind of chain of command so to speak, and I did everything that I could to address these issues and ask the State Department to do what I felt was the right thing, which was support me when it was important to do so. Because it was also about supporting the policy. I think it was for others to stand up for me.",01:44:10,Yovanovitch
947,Section_2,Adam Schiff,I quite agree. Representative Stefanik.,01:44:48,Yovanovitch
948,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"Thank you. Since the Chairman has gaveled out all of my colleagues, with their unanimous consent I am going to read for the record many of the Chairman’s comments in September of the importance of hearing from the whistleblower. Again, Ambassador, thank you for your patience, thank you for your service, but since we haven’t been able to conduct ourselves in normal procedures, I’m just going to use the five minutes for this.",01:44:53,Yovanovitch
949,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"September 29th in The Wall Street Journal, quote, “The whistleblower at the center of the impeachment investigation of President Trump will testify in the House very soon.” This is a quote by the Chairman.",01:45:17,Yovanovitch
950,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"USA Today, September 29th. Talking with ABC news this week, Schiff, the Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee said the whistleblower would testify very soon and the only thing standing in the way was getting security clearances for the attorneys representing the whistleblower so they could attend the testimony.",01:45:26,Yovanovitch
951,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"From Vox, September 29th. Rep. Adam Schiff said Sunday, “The whistleblower at the center of a growing scandal surrounding President Donald Trump will testify before the House Intelligence Committee very soon.",01:45:42,Yovanovitch

953,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"The Washington Post, September 29th. In an appearance on ABC News this week, Schiff echoed Pelosi’s message. He also said he expected the Intelligence Committee to hear from the whistleblower very soon pending a security clearance from acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph McGuire.",01:46:02,Yovanovitch

956,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"In the Washington Times, quote, “That whistleblower will be allowed to come in.”",01:46:29,Yovanovitch
957,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"These are all quotes from Chairman Adam Schiff. In Talking Points Memo the question was posed … Actually, this was by George Stephanopoulos, “Have you reached an agreement yet with a whistleblower and his or her attorneys about coming before the committee and providing the information firsthand?” Quote, “Yes, we have,” Schiff responded. “And as DNI Maguire promised during the hearing, that whistleblower will be allowed to come in and come in without a minder from the Justice Department or from the White House to tell the whistleblower what they can and cannot say. We’ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower.”",01:46:33,Yovanovitch
958,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"In Daily Kos, “We’re ready to hear from the whistleblower as soon as that is done and we’ll keep obviously riding shotgun to make sure that the acting director doesn’t delay in that clearance process.”",01:47:04,Yovanovitch

961,Section_2,Elise Stefanik,"I can keep going, but again, the Chairman refused to allow us to put these into the record with unanimous consent so I’ve read those out. And as we know, it is important to protect whistleblowers from retaliation and from firing, and we want to make sure whistleblowers are able to come forward. But in this case, the fact that we are getting criticized by Chairman Adam Schiff for statements that he himself made early on in this process shows the duplicity and just the abuse of power that we are continuing to see. With a minute 54 seconds left, I’ll yield to my colleague Mr. Jordan.",01:47:27,Yovanovitch
962,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I would also add that the Chairman has promised we’ll get to see the transcripts. But there’s still four people we’ve deposed that we have not been able to see their transcripts, have their transcripts released, and therefore the testimony they provided, we’re not able to use in these open hearings. If it’s an open hearing, all the available testimony from depositions that has been taken by the committee should be available to be discussed for the American people to see. But no, no, no, Mr. Morris and Mr. Hale and Miss Williams, two others and another one have not yet been released. So, I hope the Chairman releases that.",01:48:04,Yovanovitch
963,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"One of the point I would make in the last minute of Miss Stefanik’s time, the Democrats have asserted that this whole thing with Ambassador Yovanovitch was part of some sinister scheme by the White House to get President Zelensky to do an investigation. If for calling Ambassador Yovanovitch was part of some scheme by Trump and Pompeo and Giuliani to get President Zelensky to do an investigation, why would they replace her with the Democrat’s first witness, their star witness Bill Taylor?",01:48:42,Yovanovitch
964,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"I mean, if that’s the plan, not the best plan I’ve ever seen put together. Their star witness, their first witness, Mr. Taylor was here Wednesday. That’s what they were up to? I think that just demonstrates that that is not what went on here. Mr. Zelensky never undertook any investigations, and the reason the aid was released as we discussed on Wednesday was because Vice President Pence, Ambassador Bolton and US Senators all talked with President Zelensky and they were convinced he was the real deal as the Ambassador has alluded to in her testimony. That’s why the money was released. With that, I yield back.",01:49:20,Yovanovitch
965,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Mr. Swalwell.,01:49:57,Yovanovitch
966,Section_2,Eric Swalwell,"Mr. Chairman, a lot has changed since the whistleblower came forward. Two things in particular. First, most of what the whistleblower has alleged has been corroborated by the witnesses that we have heard from. Second, the President, who my colleagues so shamelessly continue to defend, continue to pressure, threaten and intimidate the whistleblower. So, I’d like unanimous consent to put into the record a September 26, 2019 article from Business Insider. Trump suggested the whistleblower, who filed a complaint against him, is guilty of treason, which is punishable by death.",01:49:59,Yovanovitch

972,Section_2,Eric Swalwell,"Mr. Chairman, the whistleblower has an absolute right to anonymity.

973,Section_2,Eric Swalwell,"But here, Miss Yovanovitch, we are here to talk about you and what you witnessed. And you saw a lot as it related to Mr. Giuliani, and I want to read a quote to you from Mr. Giuliani, but first ask you, when you were in Ukraine you understood that Rudy Giuliani was Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is that right?",01:51:11,Yovanovitch
974,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s right.",01:51:31,Yovanovitch
975,Section_2,Eric Swalwell,"Are you familiar with Rudy Giuliani’s quote in the New York Times describing himself as the lawyer saying quote, “He basically knows what I’m doing, sure, as his lawyer.” Were you familiar with that quote?",01:51:33,Yovanovitch

984,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,01:52:28,Yovanovitch
985,Section_2,Eric Swalwell,"He is talking publicly about designs on coming to Ukraine, but what I think is interesting is that Mr. Giuliani says we’re, as an we are. He doesn’t say I am not meddling in an election. He doesn’t say I’m not meddling in an investigation. He says, “We.” He’s speaking for himself and his client. And I want to talk about that quote, “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation.” Is it proper for you or anyone who acts on behalf of the United States Government to meddle in an investigation?",01:52:29,Yovanovitch
986,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, I don’t believe so.",01:53:09,Yovanovitch

990,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s true.",01:53:40,Yovanovitch
991,Section_2,Eric Swalwell,"And as far as the foreign aid that my colleagues keeps saying, “Well he can’t be guilty. He didn’t complete the cheat. The aid went to the Ukrainians.” Isn’t it true that the only reason the aid or the only time the aid went to the Ukrainians was after the whistleblower complaint became public?",01:53:43,Yovanovitch

994,Section_2,Eric Swalwell,"Finally, I want to put up the disgusting tweet from the President today, where he attacks your character. But I think I know who you are, Ambassador. I think the country knows who you are. He smeared you when you were in Ukraine. He smeared you on that phone call with President Zelensky on July 25. He is smearing you right now as you’re testifying. Ambassador Yovanovitch, are the President’s smears going to stop you from fighting corruption?",01:54:17,Yovanovitch

1034,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I don’t think so.,01:58:53,Yovanovitch
1035,Section_2,Will Hurd,He didn’t. Now Mr. Yermak did. Do you know of any other Ukrainians that Mr. Giuliani was meeting with that was part of the Zelensky regime?,01:58:54,Yovanovitch
1036,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, just to remind, I would have already have left Ukraine by that point. But no, I’m not aware.",01:59:07,Yovanovitch
1037,Section_2,Will Hurd,"But even with the administration to come, right? Zelensky won the election, there was a two month period of preparing to be installed as president. Even during that time, were you aware of any contact?",01:59:12,Yovanovitch

1043,Section_2,Joaquin Castro,"Thank you Chairman, and thank you Ambassador for your 33 years of service to our nation. A big question here today is why you were pushed aside as Ambassador. For example, Americans know that an employer has a right to fire an employee, but they shouldn’t do it for certain reasons. You shouldn’t be fired because you’re disabled, because you’re a woman, because you’re black, and for other reasons. I think most Americans agree that a president shouldn’t fire an Ambassador or recall an ambassador because the Ambassador is standing in his way of doing a corrupt act.",01:59:56,Yovanovitch

And I want to put aside President Trump for just a second and ask you, in all of your years of service have you ever come across a president, been asked by a president, or have known of colleagues who were asked by an American president to help that president get an American investigated overseas?",02:00:52,Yovanovitch
1053,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I’m not aware of that.,02:01:42,Yovanovitch

1055,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I mean, with what I know today, I would have said no.",02:01:56,Yovanovitch
1056,Section_2,Joaquin Castro,And would you have considered it an unlawful act?,02:02:03,Yovanovitch
1057,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I don’t know that it’s unlawful per se, but I think again, that there are channels for conducting proper investigations, and that that would have been the best way to handle something like this.",02:02:10,Yovanovitch
1058,Section_2,Joaquin Castro,But certainly it’s bizarre for a president to ask that some American be investigated by another government?,02:02:30,Yovanovitch
1059,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,It’s very unusual.,02:02:38,Yovanovitch
1060,Section_2,Joaquin Castro,"And also, you mentioned that there is corruption in Ukraine. Ukraine isn’t the only country that confronts corruption. If the people in power in a country where corruption is rampant are being asked by a foreign leader who’s got a lot of leverage over them to conduct an investigation, could that be dangerous because they could trump up charges against someone if they wanted?",02:02:40,Yovanovitch
1061,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,They could.,02:03:07,Yovanovitch
1062,Section_2,Joaquin Castro,"And I also want to ask you … I spoke to Ambassador Kent. He made a comment yesterday about selective prosecutions and what it means going forward. What kind of precedent it sets. And you’ve spoken about a dangerous precedent for the State Department and for diplomats, but I want you to help us consider the precedent going forward. If there’s no consequences for President Trump, or really any president who does this, what are the consequences for this country and for any American? Not just a former vice president or a presidential candidate or even somebody in politics, but a person in business who does business in Saudi Arabia or some other country. If a president is going to speak to another head of state or some foreign official and try to get that person investigated, what does that mean for the future of the country and for Americans?",02:03:10,Yovanovitch
1063,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I think that investigations, prosecutions, judicial decisions, properly should remain with investigators, prosecutors, and the courts. And I think that, as I said before, I think Senator Vandenberg, when he said that politics needs to stop at the water’s edge, I think he was right in that.",02:04:04,Yovanovitch
1064,Section_2,Joaquin Castro,I yield back to the Chairman.,02:04:32,Yovanovitch
1065,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Mr. Ratcliffe.,02:04:33,Yovanovitch
1066,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"I thank the Chairman, and Ambassador Yovanovitch, I’d like to join all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in thanking you for your service.",02:04:37,Yovanovitch
1067,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"I’d like to ask you about your earlier testimony about your Senate confirmation, and congresswoman Stefanik had asked you how the Obama/ Biden State Department had prepared you to answer questions about Burisma and Hunter Biden specifically. You recall that?",02:04:48,Yovanovitch
1068,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,02:05:09,Yovanovitch
1069,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"And she mentioned that you had been asked or been prepared for questions about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Burisma, but I don’t think that you gave us the answer or answers that the Obama/Biden State Department prepared you to give in response to that question. Do you remember what those answers were?",02:05:09,Yovanovitch
1070,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah. It was something along the lines of, I would refer you to the Vice President’s office on that.",02:05:30,Yovanovitch
1071,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"So did they, in the course of that, brief you about the amount of money that Hunter Biden was being by Burisma?",02:05:38,Yovanovitch
1072,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, this wasn’t part of a briefing. I mean, I had sort of big old books with questions that might come up.",02:05:45,Yovanovitch
1073,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"In preparation for your confirmation. And they thought that a Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma might be significant enough that it would come up during your confirmation, is that correct?",02:05:54,Yovanovitch
1074,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Apparently so. I mean, there were hundreds of questions.",02:06:05,Yovanovitch
1075,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"Well, hundreds of questions, but were there hundreds of companies? How many companies other than Burisma did the Obama/Biden State Department prepare you to give answers for? And if so, if there were others, which ones?",02:06:08,Yovanovitch
1076,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I just don’t recall.,02:06:27,Yovanovitch
1077,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"You don’t recall that there were any other companies, is that correct?",02:06:29,Yovanovitch
1078,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I’m quite sure there probably were some companies, but I mean, this is a while ago and I don’t recall.",02:06:33,Yovanovitch
1079,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,But you specifically recall Burisma?,02:06:39,Yovanovitch
1080,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,02:06:42,Yovanovitch
1081,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"All right. Out of thousands of companies in the Ukraine, the only one that you recall, the Obama/Biden State Department preparing you to answer questions about was the one where the Vice President’s son was on the board, is that fair?",02:06:43,Yovanovitch
1082,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,02:07:01,Yovanovitch
1083,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"You understood from Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent’s testimony as it’s been related to you that he testified a few days ago, do you understand that that arrangement, Hunter Biden’s role on the Burisma board caused him enough concern that as he testified in his statement that, “In February of 2015, I raised my concern that a Hunter Biden status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest.” And he went on to talk about the Vice President’s responsibilities over the Ukraine, or over Ukrainian policy as one of those factors. Do you recall that?",02:07:01,Yovanovitch
1084,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,02:07:40,Yovanovitch
1085,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,Do you agree with that?,02:07:40,Yovanovitch
1086,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah.,02:07:45,Yovanovitch
1087,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,That it was a legitimate concern to raise?,02:07:46,Yovanovitch
1088,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I think that it could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest.,02:07:48,Yovanovitch
1089,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,And did you discuss that ever with Mr. Kent?,02:07:55,Yovanovitch
1090,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I don’t believe so.,02:07:57,Yovanovitch
1091,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"Shortly before your confirmation in August of 2016, Prosecutor General Shokin was fired by President Poroshenko, correct?",02:07:59,Yovanovitch
1092,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,02:08:09,Yovanovitch
1093,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"And Prosecutor General Shokin was the one who had opened the investigation into Burisma, correct?",02:08:10,Yovanovitch
1094,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I think that’s right, but I’m not actually sure.",02:08:22,Yovanovitch
1095,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"He was in charge of it at least, at that point in time as the Prosecutor General.",02:08:25,Yovanovitch
1096,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Mm-hmm (affirmative).,02:08:28,Yovanovitch
1097,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"And are you aware of the very public statements by the Vice President that that firing of the prosecutor general occurred in March of 2016, six hours after the Vice President told President Poroshenko that he needed to fire the prosecutor general or that he wouldn’t receive $1 billion from the United States? Do you recall that?",02:08:29,Yovanovitch
1098,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,02:08:53,Yovanovitch
1099,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,All right. And do you think that that raises a potential concern or conflict of interest that the Vice President of the United States was ordering the firing of the prosecutor in charge of a company that has been identified as one that is substantially corrupt?,02:08:53,Yovanovitch
1100,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I actually don’t. I don’t think that the view that Mr. Shokin was not a good Prosecutor General fighting corruption, I don’t think that had anything to do with the Burisma case.",02:09:10,Yovanovitch
1101,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"But the legitimate concern about Hunter Biden’s role was legitimate, correct?",02:09:23,Yovanovitch
1102,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I think it creates a concern that there could be an appearance of conflict of interest.,02:09:29,Yovanovitch
1103,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,"Well, based on your testimony Ambassador, I’d like to renew my request, Mr. Chairman, that Hunter Biden’s testimony that has been requested-",02:09:34,Yovanovitch
1104,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Time of the gentleman has expired.,02:09:43,Yovanovitch
1105,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,Requested by the Republicans be considered-,02:09:45,Yovanovitch
1106,Section_2,Adam Schiff,The gentleman has expired. Mr. [crosstalk 02:09:47].,02:09:47,Yovanovitch
1107,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,As legitimate rather than as a sham-,02:09:48,Yovanovitch
1108,Section_2,Adam Schiff,The gentleman will suspend. The gentleman will suspend.,02:09:51,Yovanovitch
1109,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,As referred to by the Chairman.,02:09:53,Yovanovitch
1110,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Your time has expired.,02:09:54,Yovanovitch
1111,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,I have a unanimous-,02:09:54,Yovanovitch
1112,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Heck, you’re recognized.",02:09:55,Yovanovitch
1113,Section_2,John Ratcliffe,I have a unanimous consent request.,02:09:57,Yovanovitch
1114,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"You’re not recognized. Mr. Heck, you are.",02:09:58,Yovanovitch
1115,Section_2,Denny Heck,"Ambassador, I’d like to thank you very much. Add my voice of gratitude for your years of service. Frankly, you’re the best of this nation and I cannot think of anybody else I would rather have representing us in a foreign capitol than you.",02:10:01,Yovanovitch
1116,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thank you.,02:10:16,Yovanovitch
1117,Section_2,Denny Heck,"My colleagues have gone to a great deal of effort to better understand the facts surrounding your removal. I think the facts are pretty clear. There was a smear campaign, and it was orchestrated by a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor, the President’s attorney, the President’s son, and even some of the President’s allies at his favorite TV station.",02:10:17,Yovanovitch
1118,Section_2,Denny Heck,"So, that campaign led to your removal despite 33 years of outstanding service, progressive responsibility, and awards. And so I kind of sit here with a mix of emotions. On the one hand, there’s some pride and gratitude for all your outstanding service, and on the other hand I’m angry, like my friend from Connecticut. In fact, I’m very angry about how it is the most powerful person on the face of the earth would remove you from office after your stellar service, and somehow feel compelled to characterize you as bad news, and then to ominously threaten that you’re going to go through some things.",02:10:36,Yovanovitch
1119,Section_2,Denny Heck,"So I am angry, but I’m not surprised. After all, as was suggested earlier, he said the whistleblower may have committed treason, a crime punishable by death, even though the whistle blower strictly adhered to the letter of the law as independently attested to by both the Trump appointed Inspector General and the acting DNI.",02:11:21,Yovanovitch
1120,Section_2,Denny Heck,"After all, he even demeaned the memory of Senator McCain after he lied at his grave at the Naval Academy grounds, despite a lifetime of public service, and serving six years as a prisoner of war in a tiny cell in Hanoi being beaten and tortured every day.",02:11:48,Yovanovitch
1121,Section_2,Denny Heck,"And after all, he belittled the Gold Star Khan family who’s son Captain Kahn gave his last full measure of devotion out of love for this country. And let me tell you, as somebody who’s older brother never saw his 35th birthday because of service in the Vietnam War, those words are deeply offensive. Words matter, and the words leveled against you constitute bullying of the worst order. Your good character, your outstanding reputation, have been besmirched in a way that is devoid of common decency. But here’s my message to you. There is nothing Ambassador Yovanovitch, nothing he can say or do, not a thing that will in any way diminish the nature and quality of the service you have rendered to our great nation. Not a thing. And there is not a thing he can say or do that will diminish our gratitude to you for that service, and I thank you again for it.",02:12:08,Yovanovitch
1122,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thank you. Thank you.,02:13:14,Yovanovitch
1123,Section_2,Denny Heck,"So as to the larger point, I would like you to answer what does this mean to Ukraine when the United States actually engages in the kind of behavior that we are attempting to discourage them from engaging in, namely a politically motivated prosecution? What does that mean to them in their struggling efforts to become a robust democracy? What’s the impact in Ukraine for this behavior?",02:13:16,Yovanovitch
1124,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yeah. Well I think Ukraine, like many countries, looks to us for the power of our example. I think that when we engage in questionable activities, that raises a question, and it emboldens those who are corrupt, who don’t want to see Ukraine become a democracy, a free market economy, a part of Europe, but want Ukraine to stay under Russia’s thrall, and that’s not in our national security interest.",02:13:49,Yovanovitch
1125,Section_2,Denny Heck,"Thank you, Ambassador Yovanovitch. Thank you so very much.",02:14:35,Yovanovitch
1126,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thank you.,02:14:38,Yovanovitch
1127,Section_2,Denny Heck,I yield the balance of my time to the Chair.,02:14:40,Yovanovitch
1128,Section_2,Adam Schiff,I thank the gentlemen. I understand that the witness for counsel would like to take a short break. Let’s take a five minute recess.,02:14:41,Yovanovitch
1129,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Okay.,02:14:49,Yovanovitch
1130,Section_2,Adam Schiff,If members of the audience could please remain in the seats to allow the witness for counsel to leave ahead of us. We will resume in a few minutes. We are in recess.,02:14:49,Yovanovitch
1131,Section_2,Pilar Arias,"All right everybody. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for watching News Now. Pilar Arias here with you on the stream. We have been in full impeachment mode since Wednesday and we are continuing on. They say they’re taking a five minute break, but you never quite know exactly how long it’s going to be. But while I have the nearly 20,000 of you watching on YouTube right now, thousands more on Facebook, not just the Fox 10 Phoenix Facebook Live, but Facebook Lives for Fox stations across the country, I just wanted to remind you that News Now, we are normally on 13 hours a day, Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM …",02:15:03,Yovanovitch
1132,Section_2,Reporter,"All right. We are still waiting for representatives to return. The back and forth seeming to draw in Chalupa, who tweeted a defense of her work and involvement at the Ukrainian embassy in D.C.",00:06,Yovanovitch
1133,Section_2,Reporter,"This is a quote for the record: “I have never worked for a foreign government. I have never been to Ukraine. I was not an opposition researcher. In 2008, I knew Manafort worked for Putin’s interests in Ukraine. I reported my concerns about him to the NSC in 2014 and sounded the alarm bells in 2016.”",00:17,Yovanovitch
1134,Section_2,Reporter,"That was a tweet from Chalupa today. Chalupa was brought back into the spotlight when House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, the Republican from California, and top Republicans involved in the impeachment inquiry, proposed that she appear as a witness in the public phase of the investigation.",00:36,Yovanovitch
1135,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",00:55,Yovanovitch
1136,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"Ambassador, thank you for being here. Thank you for your service to our country. Ambassador, should ambassadors ever try to influence host-country elections?",00:56,Yovanovitch
1137,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,01:15,Yovanovitch
1138,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"I think you said in your opening statement, “Partisanship of this type is not compatible with the role of a career foreign service officer.” Is that right?",01:16,Yovanovitch
1139,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah.,01:23,Yovanovitch
1140,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"But that’s exactly what happened in 2016. In August of 2016, the very month you went to Ukraine as our Ambassador, the Ukrainian ambassador here in the United States, Ambassador Chaly, wrote an op-ed in The Hill, said this, “Trump’s comments send wrong message.” So the very month you’re over there as our ambassador, Ukraine Ambassador Chaly writes that op-ed.",01:25,Yovanovitch
1141,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"And it wasn’t just that attack, as Mr. Castor got into earlier. It wasn’t just that attack on the President. We had former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk who criticized Candidate Trump. We had Mr. Avakov. I believe earlier you said, Ambassador, that Mr. Avakov was the individual who first alerted you to the efforts of Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Avakov, back during this same time period in the months just prior to the 2016 election, called then-Candidate Trump all kinds of names, called him a terrorist.",01:45,Yovanovitch
1142,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"And of course we have Mr. Leshchenko, a member of Parliament who was a source for Fusion GPS in the now somewhat-famous dossier that flowed from Fusion’s work; he said this in the Financial Times, again in August of 2016 when you first arrive in Ukraine, he said this: “The majority of Ukrainians, the majority of Ukrainian politicians, are on Hillary Clinton’s side.”",02:15,Yovanovitch
1143,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"So you had several high-ranking officials in the Ukrainian government, when President Poroshenko is President of Ukraine, criticize President Trump, then-Candidate Trump, all in the late summer and fall of 2016. What I want to know, Ambassador, when this was all happening, did you go talk to anyone in Ukrainian government about this?",02:43,Yovanovitch
1144,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"Did you go say to some of these officials, “Hey you guys, you guys need to knock this off. This perception that we’ve got,” as Mr. Leshchenko said, “the majority of Ukrainian politicians on Hillary Clinton’s side. That’s not good.” Did you have that conversation?",03:03,Yovanovitch
1145,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,03:20,Yovanovitch
1146,Section_2,Jim Jordan,Didn’t talk to anyone in the government? Did you talk to President Poroshenko?,03:20,Yovanovitch
1147,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,03:24,Yovanovitch
1148,Section_2,Jim Jordan,Didn’t alert anyone in the government?,03:25,Yovanovitch
1149,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,03:28,Yovanovitch
1150,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"Well one of the things we’ve heard so much over the last six weeks in depositions, and frankly in the hearing on Wednesday, is how important bipartisan support is for Ukraine. Democrats and Republicans agree that we want to help Ukraine.",03:29,Yovanovitch
1151,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"In fact, the Democrats’ first witness, their star witness on Wednesday, Mr. Taylor, said, “Ukraine’s most important strategic asset is this bipartisan support.” And you would agree with that, right?",03:45,Yovanovitch
1152,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I do.,03:54,Yovanovitch
1153,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"He said this in his testimony on Wednesday: “On September 11th, I learned that the hold had been lifted the next day.” Ambassador Taylor said, “I conveyed this news to President Zelensky and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister. And I reminded Mr. Yarmak of the high strategic value of bipartisan support for Ukraine and the importance of not getting involved in other countries’ elections.”",03:55,Yovanovitch
1154,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"So what I’m wondering is: This is the day after the aid’s been lifted that Ambassador Taylor made this statement to the Ukrainian government; and he makes this after there’s nothing been done by Ukraine to influence our election… because President Zelensky didn’t announce he was doing an investigation, and the aid was lifted… but he felt he needed to say that.",04:15,Yovanovitch
1155,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"But in 2016, when we know that the majority of Ukrainian politicians want Clinton to win because it was said by a member of Parliament when the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine writes an op-ed criticizing then-Candidate Trump, when Mr. Avakov calls Candidate Trump all kinds of names, nobody goes and talks to him and tells him to knock it off.",04:36,Yovanovitch
1156,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"Did you have any conversations, Ambassador, with Victoria Nuland or Secretary of State Kerry about what was going on in 2016 and this majority of Ukrainian politicians being for Candidate Clinton and opposed to President Trump?",05:00,Yovanovitch
1157,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, I did not.",05:14,Yovanovitch
1158,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"No one did anything. No one did anything. Do you see why maybe the president was a little concerned about what went on in Ukraine? And you couple that with the corruption level that we know exists in Ukraine, you add to that this idea that he’s not a big fan of foreign aid, why he might be a little concerned about sending the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people to Ukraine?",05:18,Yovanovitch
1159,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I’m sorry. Is there a question in there?,05:52,Yovanovitch
1160,Section_2,Jim Jordan,There was.,05:53,Yovanovitch
1161,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Okay. Could you repeat it please?,05:54,Yovanovitch
1162,Section_2,Jim Jordan,I’m asking-,06:00,Yovanovitch
1163,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Time for the gentleman has expired, but I’ll allow you to repeat the question.",06:00,Yovanovitch
1164,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m asking… Maybe we can kind of see why the President was a little concerned, when you have the highest-ranking officials in the government, the ambassador, criticizing him; Parliamentary Member Leshchenko criticizing him; when you have Avakov, the guy who first told you about Giuliani, criticizing…",06:04,Yovanovitch
1165,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"All this going on, and when you couple that with the concerns he has about corruption, the concerns he has about Europe not doing enough, the concerns he has about reluctance to send in the hard-earned tax dollars to any country-",06:25,Yovanovitch
1166,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Jordan, I have indulged you with extra time but-",06:36,Yovanovitch
1167,Section_2,Jim Jordan,I appreciate it.,06:38,Yovanovitch
1168,Section_2,Adam Schiff,… indulgence is wearing out.,06:39,Yovanovitch
1169,Section_2,Jim Jordan,I appreciate it.,06:40,Yovanovitch
1170,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"There is a question, right?",06:41,Yovanovitch
1171,Section_2,Jim Jordan,"Our indulgence wore out with you a long time ago, Mr. Chairman. I’ll tell you that.",06:42,Yovanovitch
1172,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"I’m about to gavel you down. So if you have a question, I suggest you-",06:47,Yovanovitch
1173,Section_2,Jim Jordan,I’m asking her: Do you think there’s maybe a reason that President Trump’s concern was justified?,06:50,Yovanovitch
1174,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I can’t speak for the President on this. But what I would say is you’ve listed a number of actions. I think, from my point of view, that doesn’t create a Ukrainian government strategy to interfere in our elections.",06:58,Yovanovitch
1175,Section_2,Jim Jordan,I didn’t say that.,07:17,Yovanovitch
1176,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Jordan, please allow the ambassador to answer the question.",07:17,Yovanovitch
1177,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"So I would just say that U.S. politicians will often criticize policies of foreign counterparts, even perhaps during their elections. This happens in politics and I think that it doesn’t necessarily constitute interference.",07:21,Yovanovitch
1178,Section_2,Jim Jordan,Would you ever write an op-ed-,07:43,Yovanovitch
1179,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Jordan, your time is up.",07:45,Yovanovitch
1180,Section_2,Jim Jordan,… critical of a presidential candidate in Ukraine?,07:49,Yovanovitch
1181,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Jordan, your time has expired. Mr. Welch, you are recognized.",07:49,Yovanovitch
1182,Section_2,Peter Welch,Thank you Mr. Chairman.,07:51,Yovanovitch
1183,Section_2,Peter Welch,"Like everybody here, I’m extraordinarily grateful to you for your career of public service. And I feel very badly about what you’ve had to endure. Like your colleagues, you don’t complain, you’re doing your job. I feel badly about the insults, the tweet this morning; the fact that you were smeared, not fired.",07:55,Yovanovitch
1184,Section_2,Peter Welch,"But the question, as you know, is not how you were treated. The question is why the President did what he did, and whether what he did was a breach of trust. The question really is about whether the President of the United States, any president, has the authority to withhold congressionally approved aid, to condition a White House meeting on extracting from a foreign leader a willingness to assist him in his political campaign. That’s the question.",08:22,Yovanovitch
1185,Section_2,Peter Welch,"And that brings us to you, as part of this story, because the question is: Why were you fired from that position?",09:03,Yovanovitch
1186,Section_2,Peter Welch,"I want to read a portion of the President’s call on July 25th with President Zelensky. And this is the painful part, when you first heard about it: “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news; and the people she was dealing with in Ukraine were bad news. So I just want to let you know that.” The other thing, he goes right into this: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of the people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.”",09:16,Yovanovitch
1187,Section_2,Peter Welch,"You indicated in response to my colleague, Mr. Castro’s, question, that if you were asked to approach a foreign leader, and condition American support on their being involved in our campaign, you would refuse to do that?",09:59,Yovanovitch
1188,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes. Yes.,10:18,Yovanovitch
1189,Section_2,Peter Welch,"And you’re aware, now but I don’t know if you were then, but that July 25th phone call occurred the day after Director Mueller reported that the interference in our 2016 campaign was not from Ukraine. It was active, concerted, energetic, and by the Russians, correct?",10:19,Yovanovitch
1190,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,10:45,Yovanovitch
1191,Section_2,Peter Welch,"All right. Now, as ambassador, you had no knowledge of whatever it is President Trump ultimately seems to have wanted to get for cooperation in this investigation. That’s correct?",10:45,Yovanovitch
1192,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,11:03,Yovanovitch
1193,Section_2,Peter Welch,"All right. Now you’ve been asked about whether a president has authority to replace an ambassador, and you have agreed that that’s the president’s prerogative.",11:04,Yovanovitch
1194,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, that’s true.",11:17,Yovanovitch
1195,Section_2,Peter Welch,"But that assumes that the reasons are not related to the personal, private political interests of the president at the expense of our national security, right?",11:18,Yovanovitch
1196,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,11:32,Yovanovitch
1197,Section_2,Peter Welch,"And you’ve been the target of insults from the President. You join some very distinguished company, by the way: Senator McCain, General Kelly, men I admire. I think all of us do. General Mattis.",11:33,Yovanovitch
1198,Section_2,Peter Welch,"We’re not here to talk about that, unless the reason you get insulted as you did today, essentially blaming you for Somalia as if this is another step by the President to intimidate witnesses. He didn’t intimidate you. You’re here, you’ve endured. But there are other people out there that can expect the Trump treatment if they come forward. That’s a question for us.",11:53,Yovanovitch
1199,Section_2,Peter Welch,"Now you also indicated that the President has a prerogative to appoint a non-career person; and to be candid, Republican presidents and Democratic presidents have done that. Mr. Sondland’s transcript is out. And he was someone who indicated that everything hinged… the White House meeting and the release of the vital defensive aid… everything hinged on President Zelensky being willing to do that investigation that would benefit the Trump campaign. You’re aware of that?",12:31,Yovanovitch
1200,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,13:15,Yovanovitch
1201,Section_2,Peter Welch,And you’ve indicated that’s something that you would not agree to do?,13:16,Yovanovitch
1202,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,13:19,Yovanovitch
1203,Section_2,Peter Welch,And Sondland was quite willing to do?,13:20,Yovanovitch
1204,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Apparently so.,13:23,Yovanovitch
1205,Section_2,Peter Welch,"I thank you for your professional service, and I yield back.",13:23,Yovanovitch
1206,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thank you.,13:27,Yovanovitch
1207,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Mr. Maloney.,13:28,Yovanovitch
1208,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here. It’s been a long day. The first time, it wasn’t clear. And so I just want to start with a quick comment: Your testimony in this inquiry broke the dam. You were the first one through that stone wall that the President was trying to set up.",13:28,Yovanovitch
1209,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"And I just want to thank you for that, because others have followed your example. And there’s an old expression that the first person through the wall gets a little bit bloody, and I think you must understand that expression in a new way. But thank you.",13:48,Yovanovitch
1210,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thank you.,14:04,Yovanovitch
1211,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"I want to ask you about the day you were let go. And I know this is a painful series of events, so forgive me, but I think it’s very important. It’s April 24th, and you told us a few things that really stuck with me: You said you were at the embassy in Ukraine, you were honoring a Ukrainian woman, a anti-corruption activist, I believe her name is Kateryna Handziuk. Is that correct?",14:05,Yovanovitch
1212,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah.,14:29,Yovanovitch
1213,Section_2,Sean Maloney,Am I saying that correctly?,14:30,Yovanovitch
1214,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Mm-hmm (affirmative). I was at my house-,14:31,Yovanovitch
1215,Section_2,Sean Maloney,You were at your house?,14:32,Yovanovitch
1216,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah.,14:32,Yovanovitch
1217,Section_2,Sean Maloney,Excuse me.,14:32,Yovanovitch
1218,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Mm-hmm (affirmative).,14:32,Yovanovitch
1219,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"And you were giving her the Woman of Courage Award, I believe?",14:34,Yovanovitch
1220,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah. Embassy Kiev’s Woman of Courage Award.,14:36,Yovanovitch
1221,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"Right. And of course, that’s the day you get a call from Carol Perez, a senior member of the Foreign Service. Did you know Carol Perez?",14:40,Yovanovitch
1222,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,14:49,Yovanovitch
1223,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"You’re both senior women in the Foreign Service, you had an opportunity to meet her before?",14:50,Yovanovitch
1224,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,14:53,Yovanovitch
1225,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"And she says, “There’s trouble coming. I want to give you a heads up.” Correct me if I get this wrong… and, “I don’t know a lot, but it’s coming from the White House, I’ll call you later.”",14:53,Yovanovitch
1226,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah. That sums it up.,15:02,Yovanovitch
1227,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"But you are literally, that evening, honoring this anti-corruption activist, is that right?",15:03,Yovanovitch
1228,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,15:09,Yovanovitch
1229,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"And not just any woman, but a woman who was, you said, “horribly attacked and killed for her efforts.” And she wasn’t just killed; you said, I believe, that someone threw acid on her?",15:09,Yovanovitch
1230,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s correct.,15:24,Yovanovitch
1231,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"And I went and I checked during the break, and it turns out she was horribly injured and it took four months for her to die. Is that right?",15:26,Yovanovitch
1232,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,A very painful death.,15:33,Yovanovitch
1233,Section_2,Sean Maloney,Why would somebody attack her with acid? There are easier ways to kill people. Why do you think they did it with acid?,15:35,Yovanovitch
1234,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I think they wanted her out of the way. But I think the message was, “This could happen to you too if you continue her work.”",15:41,Yovanovitch
1235,Section_2,Sean Maloney,That’s what happens when you go up against corrupt people in Ukraine?,15:50,Yovanovitch
1236,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,It is something that can happen. There are other ways of sidelining people.,15:55,Yovanovitch
1237,Section_2,Sean Maloney,Do you remember speaking at that event?,15:58,Yovanovitch
1238,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I do.,16:00,Yovanovitch
1239,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"I went and looked at what you said. You said, “Kateryna paid the ultimate price for her fearlessness in fighting against corruption and for her determined efforts to build a democratic Ukraine.” Do you remember saying that?",16:02,Yovanovitch
1240,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,16:17,Yovanovitch
1241,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"And then your phone rings, and you hear there’s trouble up the street? And Carol Perez called you back later that night, right?",16:18,Yovanovitch
1242,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Mm-hmm (affirmative).,16:24,Yovanovitch
1243,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"It was 1:00 AM, I believe.",16:25,Yovanovitch
1244,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,16:26,Yovanovitch
1245,Section_2,Sean Maloney,Were you sleeping?,16:27,Yovanovitch
1246,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,16:28,Yovanovitch
1247,Section_2,Sean Maloney,You had stayed up to get the phone call?,16:29,Yovanovitch
1248,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,16:31,Yovanovitch
1249,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"And that’s when she says two things, I believe, that really stuck with me. She said, “We’re worried about your security”?",16:32,Yovanovitch
1250,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,16:39,Yovanovitch
1251,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"You’ve just been honoring a woman who was killed for her anti-corruption efforts. And she says, “You’ve got to get on the next plane.” Was she speaking euphemistically, “Get on the next plane, you know, “when you get time”? Did she mean, literally, the next plane?",16:41,Yovanovitch
1252,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, I think she meant “as soon as possible,” but pretty much it was the next plane.",16:55,Yovanovitch
1253,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"And that’s a pretty good flight back from Kiev to Washington, and you’re on your way to meet with Deputy Secretary Sullivan?",17:03,Yovanovitch
1254,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,17:09,Yovanovitch
1255,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"And he says to you two things. He says, “There was a concerted effort against you,” and he says, “You’ve done nothing wrong”?",17:09,Yovanovitch
1256,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Right.,17:17,Yovanovitch
1257,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"What I’m fascinated about is when he says, “You’ve done nothing wrong,” what did you expect the United States government would do next?",17:19,Yovanovitch
1258,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"It was pretty clear that a decision had been made by the President, implemented by the State Department, that I had to leave Ukraine. But I had hoped that there would be more public support.",17:30,Yovanovitch
1259,Section_2,Sean Maloney,Did you expect them to have your back?,17:43,Yovanovitch
1260,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,17:46,Yovanovitch
1261,Section_2,Sean Maloney,And were you surprised when you found out they weren’t going to?,17:49,Yovanovitch
1262,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Not at that point anymore.,17:52,Yovanovitch
1263,Section_2,Sean Maloney,Why?,17:55,Yovanovitch
1264,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, because over the last several months that had not been the case.",17:56,Yovanovitch
1265,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"Ma’am, in your opening statement, you said, “How could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government?”",18:02,Yovanovitch
1266,Section_2,Sean Maloney,“How could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government?”,18:14,Yovanovitch
1267,Section_2,Sean Maloney,"I want you to know, Ma’am, that that is the very question we are determined to get an answer for. And I want to thank you, on behalf of your country, for your service and with our work in answering that question. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.",18:19,Yovanovitch
1268,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thank you.,18:32,Yovanovitch
1269,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Ms. Demings.,18:32,Yovanovitch
1270,Section_2,Val Demings,Thank you so much Mr. Chairman.,18:37,Yovanovitch
1271,Section_2,Val Demings,"Ambassador, everyone in this room should be thankful for your service to our nation. I have four little girls in my life; and as I sit here thinking about them, and as a woman, I cannot be prouder of you. And I consider you an inspiration for women around the world.",18:38,Yovanovitch
1272,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thank you.,18:58,Yovanovitch
1273,Section_2,Val Demings,"I just have to say, before I get into my questioning, I think it’s disgraceful to hear my colleagues refer to your sworn testimony as a performance today, or speak in a condescending way, basically suggesting that “the woman”… because I think that’s how the President referred to you; I’m not sure he knows your name or there’s some other meaning there… but to basically suggest that “the woman should be thankful for whatever she was left with,” smear campaign and all, after you were recalled. But I want you to know today that we thank you for your service, your 33 years of service.",18:58,Yovanovitch
1274,Section_2,Val Demings,"Ambassador, on a press conference call on October 17th, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney discussed his belief that it’s entirely appropriate to politicize U.S. foreign policy. Here’s what he said: “If you read the news reports and you believe them, what did McKinley say yesterday? Well, McKinley said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy. That was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody: ‘Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.'”",19:50,Yovanovitch
1275,Section_2,Val Demings,"Ambassador Yovanovitch, do you share the concern raised by Ambassador McKinley in testimony before this Committee about political influence in foreign policy?",20:28,Yovanovitch
1276,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well as I said before, I think it’s important to keep political influence out of foreign policy; because we all, whether we are Republican or Democrats or something else, have common security interests and that needs to be safeguarded and advanced.",20:40,Yovanovitch
1277,Section_2,Val Demings,"And what message do you think it sends to other foreign service officers in public service, which we so desperately need good ones, when an administration refuses to support its own officials in the face of a smear campaign?",20:54,Yovanovitch
1278,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, it’s deeply troubling. It’s deeply troubling. And there are morale issues at the State Department.",21:11,Yovanovitch
1279,Section_2,Val Demings,Morale issues at the State Department? I can understand why.,21:17,Yovanovitch
1280,Section_2,Val Demings,"On March 20th of 2019, President Trump tweeted an article that included a letter from Representative Pete Sessions that said you had, and I quote, “spoken privately and repeatedly about your disdain for the current administration, in a way that might call for the expulsion of you as Ambassador to Ukraine, and immediately.”",21:21,Yovanovitch
1281,Section_2,Val Demings,Did you speak publicly and privately about your disdain for the Trump Administration?,21:42,Yovanovitch
1282,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,No.,21:48,Yovanovitch
1283,Section_2,Val Demings,Why do you think the President would want to push such a lie?,21:50,Yovanovitch
1284,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I don’t know. I don’t know.,21:57,Yovanovitch
1285,Section_2,Val Demings,"Policies change, but U.S. interests don’t, not for those who are seeking to do the work of protecting our nation, the work you have done for decades. The President, his Chief of Staff and his allies, seem to want nothing more than to smear the good people trying to protect this country and to hijack our institutions for their personal and political game.",22:01,Yovanovitch
1286,Section_2,Val Demings,"Again, Ambassador, we thank you so much for your service and I’ll yield my remaining time to the chairman.",22:31,Yovanovitch
1287,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Thank you.,22:40,Yovanovitch
1288,Section_2,Adam Schiff,I thank the gentlewoman. I’m going to go to Mr. Krishnamoorthi.,22:40,Yovanovitch
1289,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Good afternoon, Ambassador, and thank you to the family as well for being here in support of you today.",22:46,Yovanovitch
1290,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"I’d like to direct you to an area of bipartisanship, namely aid to Ukraine. Congress, on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine, correct?",22:53,Yovanovitch
1291,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,23:06,Yovanovitch
1292,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"And that aid is being used by Ukraine to fight a common adversary, namely Russia, right?",23:07,Yovanovitch
1293,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,23:13,Yovanovitch
1294,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"The U.S. in fact has consistently partnered with other European countries to keep Russia at bay and maintain the peace in Europe, right?",23:14,Yovanovitch
1295,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,23:23,Yovanovitch
1296,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"As Ambassador Taylor suggested earlier this week, supporting Ukraine helps maintain peace so that Americans don’t have to go to war again in Europe, right?",23:24,Yovanovitch
1297,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,23:35,Yovanovitch
1298,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Suspending that aid and weakening Ukraine can increase the likelihood of the opposite, correct?",23:36,Yovanovitch
1299,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Yes, it is extremely short-sighted.",23:43,Yovanovitch
1300,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"The last time you were in Ukraine was May 20th of this year, right?",23:46,Yovanovitch
1301,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,23:51,Yovanovitch
1302,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"In his opening statement, Ambassador Taylor said he took charge in Ukraine on June 17th?",23:52,Yovanovitch
1303,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,23:59,Yovanovitch
1304,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Therefore, there was almost a one-month gap between the time you departed and when Taylor took over, right?",24:00,Yovanovitch
1305,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes. Yes.,24:09,Yovanovitch
1306,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"During that time, on May 20th, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry, and others came to the inauguration of President Zelensky. Right?",24:09,Yovanovitch
1307,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,24:18,Yovanovitch
1308,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"And during that gap in time Ambassador Sondland visited the White House, along with others, and got directions from President Trump to “talk to Rudy.” Those were his words: “Talk to Rudy about what to do in Ukraine.” Right?",24:19,Yovanovitch
1309,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,That’s my understanding.,24:36,Yovanovitch
1310,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"In other words, isn’t it the case that your departure, and the one-month gap between the time you left and when Ambassador Taylor arrived, provided the perfect opportunity for another group of people to basically take over Ukraine policy? Isn’t that right?",24:37,Yovanovitch
1311,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah.,24:59,Yovanovitch
1312,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Ambassador, you’re going to have to speak a little louder into the mic.",25:02,Yovanovitch
1313,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes. Yes.,25:05,Yovanovitch
1314,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Thank you. On page 10 of your opening statement, you mentioned “corrupt interests apparently hijacking our Ukraine policy,” right?",25:06,Yovanovitch
1315,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,25:17,Yovanovitch
1316,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"A couple of suspect individuals in that regard were Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, right?",25:17,Yovanovitch
1317,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,25:23,Yovanovitch
1318,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"You mentioned, in response to Minority Counsel earlier, that you learned that Fruman and Parnas were attempting to open a liquified natural gas company. Correct?",25:24,Yovanovitch
1319,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,25:34,Yovanovitch
1320,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"How did you learn that, by the way?",25:34,Yovanovitch
1321,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I heard it from the Minister of Interior.,25:35,Yovanovitch
1322,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Interestingly, at noon today, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Rudy Giuliani stood to personally profit from that liquified natural gas venture. Do you have any knowledge of that?",25:38,Yovanovitch
1323,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"No, I do not.",25:55,Yovanovitch
1324,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Maybe we should talk to Rudy, huh?",25:56,Yovanovitch
1325,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Ambassador, I’d like to direct you to another line of questioning that I had for Ambassador Taylor earlier this week. He said that “There were irregular channels of diplomacy at work in Ukraine, circumventing normal diplomatic channels and threatening American interests in favor of private interests.”",26:01,Yovanovitch
1326,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"I asked him the question: “Can you rule out the possibility that these irregular channels of diplomacy are being used in other countries where we conduct foreign policy?” In response, he said that he could not rule it out.",26:19,Yovanovitch
1327,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Ambassador Yovanovitch, I ask you, and I assume that you can’t rule it out either. Correct?",26:32,Yovanovitch
1328,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"I can’t. But I would also add, I have no knowledge of that.",26:40,Yovanovitch
1329,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,I understand. Are you concerned that these irregular channels of diplomacy may be at work elsewhere?,26:42,Yovanovitch
1330,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,I think it’s a possibility.,26:50,Yovanovitch
1331,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,You testified that it was a “dangerous precedent that private interests and people who don’t like a particular ambassador could combine to replace that ambassador.” Are you concerned that other ambassadors may suffer the same fate as you?,26:52,Yovanovitch
1332,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,27:08,Yovanovitch
1333,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Ambassador, in your service as an American diplomat, you have encountered various dictators and strong men ruling other countries, right?",27:11,Yovanovitch
1334,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,27:19,Yovanovitch
1335,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"In your personal life, your parents fled the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and they became familiar with despots and dictators as well, correct?",27:21,Yovanovitch
1336,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,27:32,Yovanovitch
1337,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,"Indeed, you’re an authority on authoritarianism, right?",27:33,Yovanovitch
1338,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Well, maybe.",27:37,Yovanovitch
1339,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,Is it a feature of authoritarianism to allow corrupt interests to hijack foreign policy?,27:39,Yovanovitch
1340,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yeah.,27:46,Yovanovitch
1341,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,Is it a feature of authoritarianism for the rulers there to claim absolute rights?,27:47,Yovanovitch
1342,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,Yes.,27:55,Yovanovitch
1343,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,And is it a hallmark of authoritarianism for those rulers to smear their opponents?,27:56,Yovanovitch
1344,Section_2,Marie Yovanovitch,"Sometimes, yes.",28:03,Yovanovitch
1345,Section_2,Krishnamoorthi,Thank you.,28:04,Yovanovitch
1346,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Nunes, do you have any concluding remarks?",28:04,Yovanovitch
1347,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"I would just say to the American people, today’s show trial has come to an end.",28:13,Yovanovitch
1348,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"We’re headed down now to the basement of the Capitol to go until… I don’t know what time. And we’ll be back there hiding again behind the closed doors, interviewing more witnesses that you may or may not be able to see in the public. I hate to break it to my colleagues if there’s anyone else out there watching television ratings, but they must be plummeting right now.",28:19,Yovanovitch
1349,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"And I would suggest that we get back to the work of the Intelligence Committee, that we pass a trade agreement with the United States, Mexico and Canada that would actually help the American people out. Because this is an embarrassment. I’ll yield back.",28:46,Yovanovitch
1350,Section_2,Speaker 10,"Mr. Chairman, may be recognized for a motion?",29:03,Yovanovitch
1351,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"No, I have some Chairman concluding remarks. Ambassador, I want to thank you for your decades of service. I want to thank you, as Mr. Mr. Maloney said, for being the first one through the gap.",29:05,Yovanovitch
1352,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"What you did in coming forward, and answering a lawful subpoena, was to give courage to others that also witnessed wrongdoing, that they too could show the same courage that you have, that they could stand up, speak out, answer questions; they could endure whatever threats, insults, may come their way. And so in your long and distinguished career, you have done another great public service in answering the call of our subpoena and testifying before us today.",29:20,Yovanovitch
1353,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"I think you gathered from our comments that we not only grieve for what you went through, but what damage is being done to the State Department, to career Foreign Service Officers, all over the country. I am profoundly grateful to you and Mr. Kent, and Ambassador Taylor, who have done so much in the last two days, or three days, to show the American people the face of our diplomatic corps, the extraordinary public servants who work all around the world in very dangerous places as you have.",29:59,Yovanovitch
1354,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"And so I’m glad they’ve gotten to see you. Because you’re often vilified as bureaucrats, or diplomacy is diminished as unimportant. Anything other than the military doesn’t really matter, when it’s your efforts that often prevent us from going to war. Sometimes you are disparaged as the deep state. But what you are is what holds this country together, what holds our foreign policy together, what makes it seamless, what makes it work. And I’m glad America gets to see that.",30:37,Yovanovitch
1355,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"I will just emphasize, once again, about the importance of your testimony. Mr. Kent and Ambassador Taylor gave us the broad outlines of this story. This is a story about an effort to coerce, condition, or bribe a foreign country into doing the dirty work of the President: investigations of his political rival by conditioning U.S. taxpayer money, by conditioning a meeting that President Zelensky desperately wanted and needed to establish that relationship with the most powerful patron of Ukraine, the United States of America.",31:17,Yovanovitch
1356,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"The fact that they failed in this solicitation of bribery doesn’t make it any less bribery, doesn’t make it any less immoral or corrupt. It just means it was unsuccessful. And to that we owe other dedicated public servants who blew the whistle; had they not blown the whistle, we wouldn’t be here. And I think it is appalling that my colleagues continue to want to out this whistleblower so that he or she can be punished by this president.",31:58,Yovanovitch
1357,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"But let’s underscore once again: While you are the beginning of this story, you’re not the end of it; but nonetheless the beginning is important, because the beginning of the story is an effort to get you out of the way. An effort by Rudy Giuliani, and Fruman and Parnas, and corrupt Ukrainians like Lutsenko, to get you out of the way because they felt you were an impediment to these political investigations the Presence of desperately wanted.",32:30,Yovanovitch
1358,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Giuliani has made it abundantly clear: He was in Ukraine, on a mission for his client; for the President to investigate the Bidens. And you are viewed as an obstacle that had to go; not just by Giuliani, but by the President of the United States. And if people had any doubt about it, they should do what the president asks: Read the transcript.",33:01,Yovanovitch
1359,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"And what they’ll see in that transcript is, the President praises the corrupt. He praises the corrupt Lutsenko. He condemns the just, you. And then he asks for an investigation of the Bidens. There is no camouflaging that corrupt intent.",33:25,Yovanovitch
1360,Section_2,Adam Schiff,We are adjourned.,33:53,Yovanovitch
1361,Section_2,Speaker 11,"Mr. Speaker, [inaudible 00:33:55] condition?",33:54,Yovanovitch
1362,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Please, allow the witness to leave-",33:56,Yovanovitch
1363,Section_2,Speaker 11,"Mr. Chairman, you disparage [crosstalk 00:33:58], you disparage those members on this side of the aisle. We should have a chance to respond to your disparaging remarks. Mr Chairman, I demand, or seek… Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman [inaudible 00:34:11]",33:58,Yovanovitch
0,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Last week, we heard from three experienced diplomats who testified about President Trump’s scheme to condition official acts, a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars of US military aid to fight the Russians, on a deliverable by the new Ukrainian President Zelensky, two politically-moded investigations that Trump believed would help his reelection campaign. One of those investigations involved the Bidens and the other involved a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine and not Russia was responsible for interfering in our 2016 election.",00:08,Vindman/Williams
2,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"As Ambassador Sondland would later tell career Foreign Service Officer David Holmes immediately after speaking to the President, “Trump did not give a-” he then used an expletive, “about Ukraine. He cares about big stuff that benefits the President, like the Biden investigation that Giuliani was pushing.” To press a foreign leader to announce an investigation into his political rival, President Trump put his own personal and political interests above those of the nation. He undermined our military and diplomatic support for a key ally, and undercut US anticorruption efforts in Ukraine. How could our diplomats urge Ukraine to refrain from political investigations of its own citizens if the President of the United States was urging Ukraine to engage in precisely the same kind of corrupt and political investigations of one of our own citizens?",00:45,Vindman/Williams
3,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"At the White House, career professionals became concerned that President Trump, through an irregular channel that involved his acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, was pushing a policy towards Ukraine at odds with the national interest. This morning we hear from two of the national security professionals who became aware of these efforts. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, whose family fled oppression in the Soviet Union when he was a toddler, is a career Army officer, an Iraq War veteran who was awarded a Purple Heart, and an expert in Russia and Ukraine who has worked at the highest levels of the Pentagon. In July 2018, he was detailed to the White House, in part to coordinate policy on Ukraine. Jennifer Williams is a career Foreign Service Officer who is currently detailed to the Office of the Vice-President and responsible for Europe and Eurasia related issues.",01:41,Vindman/Williams
4,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Following his initial and congratulatory phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky on April 21, Trump asked Vice President Pence to represent him at Zelensky’s upcoming inauguration. Ms. Williams was working on logistics for the trip. Pence would be a coveted attendee, second in significance only to the President, and it would have sent an important signal of support to the new Ukrainian President. In early May, however, Rudy Giuliani had been planning to go to Ukraine to pursue the President’s interest in having the Bidens investigated, but had to call off the trip after it became public. Among others, Giuliani blamed people around Zelensky for having to cancel, and claimed they were antagonistic to Trump. Three days later, the President called off the Vice President’s attendance at Zelensky’s inauguration. Instead, a lower level delegation was named: Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Ambassador Sondland, and Ambassador Kurt Volker, the Three Amigos. Senator Ron Johnson and Lt. Col. Vindman would also attend.",02:40,Vindman/Williams
5,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"After returning from the inauguration, several members of the delegation briefed President Trump on their encouraging first interactions with Zelensky. They urged Trump to meet with the Ukrainian President, but Trump instead criticized Ukraine and instructed them to “work with Rudy.” A few weeks later, on July 10, Ambassador Sondland met at the White House with a group of US and Ukrainian officials, including Colonel Vindman, and informed the group that according to Chief of Staff Mulvaney, the White House meeting sought by the Ukrainian President with Trump would happen if Ukraine undertook certain investigations. National Security Advisor Bolton abruptly ended the meeting and said afterwards that he would not be “part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this.”",03:47,Vindman/Williams
6,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Undeterred, Sondland brought the Ukrainian delegation downstairs to another part of the White House and was more explicit, according to witnesses. Ukraine needed to investigate the Bidens or Burisma if they were to get a White House meeting with Trump. After this discussion, which Vindman witnessed, he went to the National Security Council’s top lawyer to report the matter. Vindman was told to return in the future with any concerns. He would soon find the need to do so.",04:36,Vindman/Williams
7,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"A week later, on July 18, a representative of the Office of Management and Budget announced on a video conference call that Mulvaney, at Trump’s direction, was freezing nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine which was appropriated by Congress and enjoyed the support of the entirety of the US national security establishment. And one week after that, Trump would have the now infamous July 25 phone call with Zelensky. During that call, Trump complained that the U.S. relationship with Ukraine had not been “reciprocal.” Later, Zelensky thanks Trump for his support “in the area of defense,” and says that Ukraine was ready to purchase more Javelins, an antitank weapon that was among the most important deterrents of further Russian military action. Trump’s immediate response: “I would like you to do us a favor, though.”",05:02,Vindman/Williams
8,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Trump then requested that Zelensky investigate the discredited 2016 conspiracy theory, and even more ominously, look into the Bidens. Neither was part of the official preparatory material for the call, but they were in Donald Trump’s personal interest, and in the interests of his 2020 re-election campaign. And the Ukrainian President knew about both in advance, because Sondland and others had been pressing Ukraine for weeks about investigations into the 2016 election, Burisma and the Bidens.",05:54,Vindman/Williams
9,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Both Col. Vindman and Ms. Williams were on the July 25 call. Vindman testified that due to the unequal bargaining position of the two leaders and Ukraine’s dependency on the US, the favor Trump asked of Zelensky was really a demand. After the call, multiple individuals, including Vindman, were concerned enough to report it to the National Security Council’s top lawyer. It was the second time in two weeks that Vindman had raised concerns with the NSC lawyers. For her part, Williams also believed that asking Zelensky to undertake these political investigations was inappropriate, and that it might explain something else she had become aware of, the otherwise inexplicable hold on US military assistance to Ukraine .",06:26,Vindman/Williams
10,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Both Col. Vindman and Ms. Williams also took note of the explicit use of the word Burisma by Zelensky, a fact conspicuously left out of the record of the call, now locked away on an ultra-secure server. Col. Vindman believed that Zelensky must have been prepped for the call to be able to make the connection between Biden and Burisma, a fact that other witnesses have now confirmed.",07:10,Vindman/Williams
11,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In the weeks that followed the July 25 call, Col. Vindman continued to push for a release of the military aid to Ukraine, and struggled to learn why it was being withheld. More disturbing, word of the hold had reached Ukrainian officials prior to it becoming public. By mid-August, the Ukrainian Deputy Ambassador asked Vindman why the United States was withholding the aid. Although Vindman didn’t have an answer, Sondland made it explicit to the Ukrainians at a meeting in Warsaw: They needed to publicly commit to these two investigations if they hoped to get the aid.",07:33,Vindman/Williams
12,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Ms. Williams, we all saw the President’s tweet about you on Sunday afternoon and the insults he hurled at Ambassador Yovanovich last Friday. You are here today, and the American people are grateful. Col. Vindman, we have seen far more scurrilous attacks on your character, and watched as certain personalities on Fox have questioned your loyalty. I note that you have shed blood for America, and we owe you an immense debt of gratitude. I hope no one on this committee will become part of those vicious attacks.",08:09,Vindman/Williams
13,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Today’s witnesses, like those who testified last week, are here because they were subpoenaed to appear, not because they are for or against impeachment. That question is for Congress, not the fact witnesses. If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts, a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid, it will be up to us to decide whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency.",08:42,Vindman/Williams
14,Section_1,Adam Schiff,I now recognize ranking member Nunes for any remarks he’d like to make.,09:24,Vindman/Williams
15,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Thanks, gentlemen. I’d like to address a few brief words to the American people watching at home. If you watched the impeachment hearings last week, you may have noticed a disconnect between what you actually saw and the mainstream media accounts describing it. When you saw three diplomats who disliked President Trump’s Ukraine policy discussing secondhand and third-hand conversations about their objections with the Trump policy. Meanwhile, they admitted they had not talked to the President about these matters and they were unable to identify any crime or impeachable offense the President committed.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
16,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"But what you read in the press were accounts of shocking, damning, and explosive testimony that fully supports the Democrats accusations. If these accounts have a familiar ring, it’s because this is the same preposterous reporting the media offered for three years on the Russian hoax. On a nearly daily basis, the top news outlets in America reported breathlessly on the newest bombshell revelations showing that President Trump and everyone surrounding him were Russian agents. It really wasn’t long ago that we were reading these headlines. From CNN, “Congress Investigating Russian Investment Fund Ties to Trump Officials.” This was false.",00:39,Vindman/Williams
17,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"New York Times, “Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated contacts with Russian Intelligence.” Also, false. “Slate was a Trump Server Communicating with Russia.” This was false. New York Magazine, “Will Trump Be Meeting with His Counterpart or His Handler?” This was false. The Guardian, “Manafort Held Secret Talks with Assange in Ecuadorian Embassy.” Also, false. Buzzfeed, “President Trump Directed His Attorney to Lie to Congress About the Moscow Tower Project.” All of these were false. There was no objectivity or fairness in the media’s Russia stories, just as a fevered rush to tarnish and remove a President who refuses to pretend that the media are something different from what they really are, puppets of the Democratic party.",01:25,Vindman/Williams
18,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"With their bias misreporting on the Russia hoax, the media lost confidence of millions of Americans, and because they refuse to acknowledge how badly they botched the story, they’ve learned no lessons and simply expect Americans will believe them as they try to stoke yet another partisan frenzy. In previous hearings, I’ve outlined three questions the Democrats in the media don’t want asked or answered. Instead of shedding light on these crucial questions, the media are trying to smother and dismiss them. Those questions start with, what is the full extent of the Democrats’ prior coordination with the whistleblower, and who else did the whistleblower coordinate this effort with?",02:23,Vindman/Williams
19,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"The media have fully accepted the Democrats stunning reversal on the need for the whistleblower to testify to this committee. When the Democrats were insisting on his testimony, the media wanted it too, but things have changed since it became clear the whistleblower would have to answer problematic questions that include these. What was the full extent of the whistleblowers’ prior coordination with Chairman Schiff, his staff, and any other people he cooperated with while preparing the complaint? What are the whistleblowers’ political biases and connections to Democratic politicians? How does the whistleblower explain the inaccuracies in the complaint?",03:06,Vindman/Williams
20,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"What contact did the whistleblower have with the media, which appears to be ongoing? What are the sources of the whistleblowers’ information? Who else did he talk to and was the whistleblower prohibited by law from receiving or conveying any of that information? The media have joined the Democrats in dismissing the importance of cross-examining this crucial witness. Now that the whistleblower has successfully kickstarted impeachment, he has disappeared from the story, as if the Democrats put the whistleblower in their own witness protection program. My second question, what was the full extent of Ukraine’s election meddling against the Trump campaign?",03:51,Vindman/Williams
21,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"In these depositions and hearings, Republicans have cited numerous indications of Ukraine meddling in the 2016 elections to oppose the Trump campaign. Many of these instances were reported, including the posting of many primary source documents by veteran investigative journalist, John Solomon. Since the Democrats switched from Russia to Ukraine for their impeachment crusade, Solomon’s reporting on Burisma, Hunter Biden and Ukraine election meddling has become inconvenient for the Democratic narrative, and so the media is furiously smearing and libeling Solomon. In fact, the publication, The Hill, told its staff yesterday it would conduct a review of Solomon’s Ukraine reporting.",04:37,Vindman/Williams
22,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Coincidentally, the decision comes just three days after a Democrat on this committee told a Hill writer that she would stop speaking to The Hill because it had run Solomon’s stories and she urged the writer to relay her concerns to Hills’ management. So now that Solomon’s reporting is a problem for the Democrats, it’s a problem for the media as well. I’d like to submit for the record, John Solomon’s October 31st story entitled, Debunking Some of Ukraine Scandal Myths About Biden and Election Interference. I encourage viewers today to read this story and draw your own conclusions about the evidence Solomon has gathered. I ask unanimous consent that we put this into the record, Mr. Chair?",05:23,Vindman/Williams
23,Section_2,Adam Schiff,Without objection.,06:15,Vindman/Williams
24,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"The concerted campaign by the media to discredit and disown some of their own colleagues is shocking. And we see it again in the sudden denunciations of New York Times reporter, Ken Vogel, as a conspiracy theorist after he covered similar issues, including a 2017 political piece entitled, Ukrainian Efforts to Sabotage Trump Backfire. My third question, why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden? What did he do for them and did his position affect any US government actions under the Obama administration? We have now heard testimony from the Democrats’ own witnesses that diplomats were concerned about a conflict of interest involving Hunter Biden.",06:18,Vindman/Williams
25,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"That’s because he had secured a well paid position, despite having no qualifications on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian company, while his father was Vice President charged with overseeing Ukrainian issues. After trying out several different accusations against President Trump, the Democrats have recently settled on bribery. According to widespread reports, they replaced their quid pro quo allegation because it wasn’t polling well. But if the Democrats in the media are suddenly so deeply concerned about bribery, you would think they would take some interest in Burisma paying Hunter Biden $83,000 a month, and you think they would be interested in Joe Biden threatening to withhold US loan guarantees unless the Ukrainians fired a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.",07:06,Vindman/Williams
26,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"That would be a textbook example of bribery. The media, of course, are free to act as Democrat puppets, and they’re free to lurch from the Russia hoax to the Ukraine hoax at the direction of their puppet masters. But they cannot reasonably expect to do so without alienating half the country who voted for the President they’re trying to expel. Americans have learned to recognize fake news when they see it, and if the mainstream press won’t give it to them straight, they’ll go elsewhere to find it, which is exactly what the American people are doing. With that, I yield back.",08:03,Vindman/Williams
27,Section_2,Jennifer Williams,"Thank you Chairman Schiff, ranking member Nunez and other members of the committee for the opportunity to provide this statement. I appear today pursuant to a subpoena and I’m prepared to answer your questions to the best of my abilities.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
28,Section_3,Jennifer Williams,"I have had the privilege of working as a foreign service officer for nearly 14 years, working for three different presidential administrations, two Republican and one Democratic. I joined the State Department in 2006 after serving in the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Michael Chertoff. It was with great pride and conviction that I swore an oath to uphold and defend the constitution administered by a personal hero of mine, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. As a career officer, I am committed to serving the American people and advancing American interests abroad in support of the president’s foreign policy objectives. I have been inspired and encouraged in that journey by the thousands of other dedicated public servants who I’m proud to call colleagues across the foreign service, civil service, military and federal law enforcement agencies.",00:14,Vindman/Williams
29,Section_3,Jennifer Williams,"I have served overseas tours in Kingston, Jamaica; Beirut, Lebanon; and London, United Kingdom. I have worked to implement humanitarian assistance programs to serve millions of victims of the Syria conflict, and served as an advisor on middle East issues to the Deputy Secretary of State. And this spring, it was the greatest honor of my career to be asked to serve as a special advisor to the Vice President for Europe and Russia.",01:08,Vindman/Williams
30,Section_3,Jennifer Williams,"Over the past eight months I have been privileged to work with the dedicated and capable men and women of the office of the Vice President to advance the administration’s agenda. I have also worked closely with talented and committed colleagues at the National Security Council, State Department, Department of Defense, and other agencies to advance and promote U.S. foreign policy objectives. In this capacity I have advised and prepared the Vice President for engagements related to Ukraine. As you are aware, on November 7th I appeared before the committee for a closed door deposition pursuant to a subpoena.",01:34,Vindman/Williams
31,Section_3,Jennifer Williams,I would like to take this opportunity to briefly summarize my recollection of some of the events I expect the committee may ask me about.,02:12,Vindman/Williams
32,Section_3,Jennifer Williams,"On April 21st, Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian presidential election. On April 23rd, the Vice President called to congratulate President-elect Zelensky. During the call, which I participated in, the Vice President accepted an invitation to attend President-elect Zelensky’s upcoming inauguration, providing that the scheduling worked out. The Vice President had only a narrow window of availability at the end of May and the Ukrainian parliament would not meet to set a date for the inauguration until after May 14th. As a result, we did not expect to know whether the Vice President would be, could attend until May 14th at the earliest and we made only preliminary trip preparations in early May. On May 13th, an assistant to the Vice President’s Chief of Staff called and informed me that President Trump had decided that the Vice President would not attend the inauguration in Ukraine.",02:21,Vindman/Williams
33,Section_3,Jennifer Williams,"She did not provide any further explanation. I relayed that instruction to others involved in planning the potential trip. I also informed the NSC that the Vice President would not be attending so that it could identify a head of delegation to represent the United States at President-elect Zelensky’s inauguration. On July 3rd, I learned that the Office of Management and Budget had placed a hold on a traunch of security assistance designated for Ukraine. According to the information I received, OMB was reviewing whether the funding was aligned with the administration’s priorities. I subsequently attended meetings of the policy coordination committee where the hold on Ukrainian security assistance was discussed. During those meetings, representatives of the state and defense departments advocated that the hold should be lifted, and OMB representatives reported that the White House Chief of Staff had directed that the hold should remain in place. On September 11th, I learned that the hold on security assistance for Ukraine had been released. I have never learned what prompted that decision.",03:15,Vindman/Williams
34,Section_3,Jennifer Williams,"On July 25th, along with several of my colleagues, I listened to a call between President Trump and President Zelensky, the content of which has since been publicly reported. Prior to July 25th, I had participated in roughly a dozen other presidential phone calls. During my closed door deposition members of the committee asked about my personal views and whether I had any concerns about the July 25th call. As I testified then, I found the July 25th phone call unusual because in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter. After the July 25th call, I provided an update in the Vice President’s daily briefing book, indicating that President Trump had a call that day with President Zelensky. A hard copy of the memorandum transcribing the call was also included in the book. I do not know whether the Vice President reviewed my update or the transcript. I did not discuss the July 25th call with Vice President or any of my colleagues in the office of the Vice President or the NSC.",04:23,Vindman/Williams
35,Section_3,Jennifer Williams,"On August 29th, I learned that the Vice President would be traveling to Poland to meet with President Zelensky on September 1st. At the September 1st meeting, which I attended, President Zelensky asked the Vice President about news articles reporting a hold on U.S. security assistance for Ukraine. The Vice President responded that Ukraine had the United States’ unwavering support and promised to relay their conversation to President Trump that night. During the September 1st meeting, neither the Vice President nor President Zelensky mentioned the specific investigations discussed during the July 25th phone call.",05:29,Vindman/Williams
36,Section_3,Jennifer Williams,Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this statement. I’d be happy to answer any questions.,06:07,Vindman/Williams
37,Section_3,Alexander Vindman,"Mister Chairman, ranking members, thank you for the opportunity to address the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with respect to the activities relating to Ukraine and my role in the events under investigation. I’ve dedicated my entire professional life to the United States of America. For more than two decades, it has been my honor to serve as an officer in United States Army. As an infantry officer I served multiple overseas tours including South Korea and Germany, and I was deployed to Iraq for combat operations.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
38,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"Since 2008 I have been a Foreign Area Officer specializing in European and Eurasian political military affairs. I served in the United States embassies in Kiev, Ukraine and Moscow, Russia. In Washington D.C I was the political military affairs officer for Russia, for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where I drafted the Armed Forces global campaign plan to counter Russian aggression and Russian malign influence.",00:29,Vindman/Williams
39,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"In July of 2018 I was asked to serve at the White House national security council. At the NSC I’m the principal advisor to the National Security Advisor on Ukraine and other countries in my portfolio. My role at the NSC is to develop, coordinate, and implement plans and policies to manage the full range of diplomatic, informational, military and economic national security issues, the countries in my portfolio. My core function is to coordinate policy with departments and agencies.",00:53,Vindman/Williams
40,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"The committee has heard from many of my colleagues about the strategic importance of Ukraine as a bulwark against Russian aggression. It is important to know that our country’s policy of supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, promoting Ukrainian prosperity, instructing a free and democratic Ukraine as a counter to Russian aggression, has been a consistent bipartisan foreign policy objective and strategy across the various administrations, both Democratic and Republican, and that president Zelensky’s election in April, 2019 created an unprecedented opportunity to realize our strategic objectives.",01:24,Vindman/Williams
41,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"In the spring of 2019 I became aware of two disruptive actors, primarily Ukraine’s then prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko and former mayor Rudolph Giuliani, president’s personal attorney, promoting false narratives that undermined the United States Ukraine policy. The NSC and its interagency partners, including the state department, grew increasingly concerned about the impact that such information was having on our country’s ability to achieve our national security objectives.",02:01,Vindman/Williams
42,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"On April 21, 2019 Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine in a landslide victory on a unity, reform, and anti-corruption platform. President Trump called President Zelensky on April 21, 2019 to congratulate him on his victory. I was the staff officer who produced the call materials and was one of the staff officers who listened to the call. The call was positive and President Trump expressed his desire to work with president Zelensky and extended an invitation to visit the White House. In May, I attended the inauguration of President Zelensky as part of the presidential delegation led by Secretary Perry.",02:29,Vindman/Williams
43,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"Following the visit, the members of the delegation provided President Trump a debriefing, offering a positive assessment of President Zelensky and his team. After this debriefing, President Trump signed a congratulatory letter to President Zelensky and extended another invitation to visit the White House. On July 10, 2019 Oleksandr Danylyuk, then Ukraine’s National Security Advisor visited Washington D.C for a meeting with National Security Advisor Bolton. Ambassador Volker and Sondland, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, and Secretary Rick Perry also attended the meeting. I attended with Dr. Hill.",03:07,Vindman/Williams
44,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"We fully anticipated the Ukrainians would raise the issue of meeting, of a meeting between the presidents. Ambassador Bolton cut the meeting short when Ambassador Sondland started to speak about the requirement that Ukraine deliver specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with President Trump. Following this meeting, there was a short debriefing during which Ambassador Sondland emphasized the importance of Ukraine delivering the investigations into the 2016 elections, the Bidens and Burisma.",03:45,Vindman/Williams
45,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"I stated to Ambassador Sondland that this was inappropriate and it had nothing to do with national security. Dr. Hill also asserted his comments weren’t proper. Following the meeting, Dr. Hill and I agreed to report the incident to the NSC’s lead counsel, Mr. John Eisenberg. On July 21, 2019 President Zelensky won a parliamentary election in another landslide victory. The NSC proposed that President Trump call President Zelensky to congratulate him.",04:11,Vindman/Williams
46,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"On July 25, 2019 the call occurred. I listened in on the call in the situation room with White House colleagues. I was concerned by the call. What I heard was inappropriate and I reported my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg. It is improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a US citizen and a political opponent.",04:40,Vindman/Williams
47,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"I was also clear that if Ukraine pursued investigation, it was also clear that if Ukraine pursued investigation into the 2016 elections, the Bidens and Burisma, it would be interpreted as a partisan play. This would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing bipartisan support, undermining US national security and advancing Russia’s strategic objectives in the region.",05:05,Vindman/Williams
48,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"I want to emphasize to the committee that when I reported my concerns on July 10th relating to Ambassador Sondland and then July 25th relating to the President, I did so out of a sense of duty. I privately reported my concerns in official channels to the proper authority in the chain of command. My intent was to raise these concerns because they had significant national security implications for our country. I never thought that I’d be sitting here testifying in front of this committee and the American public about my actions. When I reported my concerns, my only thought was to act properly and to carry out my duty.",05:27,Vindman/Williams
49,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"Following each of my reports to Mr. Eisenberg, I immediately returned to work to advance the Presidents and our country’s foreign policy objectives. I focused on what I have done throughout my military career, promoting America’s national security interests. I want to take a moment to recognize the courage of my colleagues who are appeared and are scheduled to appear before this committee. I want to say that the character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible. It is natural to disagree and engage in spirited debate. This has been the custom of our country since the time of our founding fathers, but we are better than personal attacks. The uniform I wear today is that of the United States Army, is that of the United States Army. The members of our all volunteer force are made up of a patchwork of people from all ethnicities, regions, socioeconomic backgrounds who come together under a common oath to protect and defend the constitution of the United States of America.",06:05,Vindman/Williams
50,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,We do not serve any political party. We serve the nation. I am humbled to come before you today as one of many who serve in the most distinguished and able military in the world. The Army is the only profession I have ever known. As a young man I decided I wanted to spend my life serving this nation. It gave my family that gave my family refuge from authoritarian depression. For the last 20 years it has been an honor to represent and protect this great country.,07:04,Vindman/Williams
51,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"Next month will mark 40 years since my family arrived in the United States as refugees. When my father was 47 years old, he left behind his entire life and the only home he had ever known to start over in the United States so his three sons could have a better and safer lives.",07:32,Vindman/Williams
52,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"His courageous decision inspired a deep sense of gratitude in my brothers and myself, and instilled in us a sense of duty and service. All three of us have served or are currently serving in the military. My little brother sits behind me here today. Our collective military service is a special part of our family’s history and story in America.",07:51,Vindman/Williams
53,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"I also recognize that my simple act of appearing here today, just like the courage of my colleagues who have also truthfully testified before this committee would not be tolerated in many places around the world. In Russia, my act of expressing concern to the chain of command in an official and private channel would have severe personal and professional repercussions, and offering public testimony involving the president would surely cost me my life. I am grateful for my father’s brave act of hope 40 years ago and for the privilege of being an American citizen and public servant, where can live free, and free of fear for mine and my family’s safety.",08:14,Vindman/Williams
54,Section_4,Alexander Vindman,"Dad, I’m sitting here today in the US Capitol talking to our elected professionals, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union, come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth. Thank you again for your consideration. I’ll be happy to answer your questions.",08:56,Vindman/Williams
55,Section_4,Adam Schiff,"Before we get into the substance of your testimony. Ms. Williams, I want to ask you about a phone call between Vice President Pence and President Zelensky of Ukraine on September 18th were you on that call?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
56,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,I was.,00:16,Vindman/Williams
57,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And did you take notes of the call?,00:17,Vindman/Williams
58,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,"Yes, sir.",00:19,Vindman/Williams
59,Section_5,Adam Schiff,Is there something about that call that you think may be relevant to our investigation?,00:20,Vindman/Williams
60,Section_5,Speaker 3,"Mr. Chairman, as we previously discussed with the committee, the office of the vice president has taken the position that the September-",00:25,Vindman/Williams
61,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Sir, could you move the microphone a little closer to …",00:32,Vindman/Williams
62,Section_5,Speaker 3,"As we’ve previously discussed with both majority and minority staff of the committee, the office of the vice president has taken the position that the September 18th call is classified. As a result, with respect to the call, I’d refer the committee to the public record, which includes Ms. Williams November 7th testimony, which has been publicly released. As well as the public readout of that call, which is previously been issued by the white house.",00:36,Vindman/Williams
63,Section_5,Speaker 3,"Beyond that, given the position of the vice president’s office on classification, I’ve advised Ms. Williams not to answer further questions about that call in an unclassified setting.",01:04,Vindman/Williams
64,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Williams, I only ask you in this setting whether you think there’s something relevant to our inquiry in that call and whether if so you’ll be willing to make a classified submission to the committee.",01:16,Vindman/Williams
65,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,"I would also refer to my testimony that I gave in the closed session, and I’m very happy to appear for a classified setting discussion as well.",01:28,Vindman/Williams
66,Section_5,Adam Schiff,It may not be necessary for you to appear if you’ll be willing to submit the information in writing to the committee.,01:38,Vindman/Williams
67,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,I’d be happy to do so.,01:43,Vindman/Williams
68,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"I thank you. Colonel Vindman, if I could turn your attention to the April 21st call. That is the first call between President Trump and President Zelensky. Did you prepare talking points for the president to use during that call?",01:45,Vindman/Williams
69,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I did.",02:03,Vindman/Williams
70,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And did those talking points include rooting out corruption in Ukraine?,02:05,Vindman/Williams
71,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,02:10,Vindman/Williams
72,Section_5,Adam Schiff,That was something the president was supposed to raise in the conversation with President Zelensky?,02:11,Vindman/Williams
73,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Those were the recommended talking points that were cleared through the NSC staff for the president, yes.",02:16,Vindman/Williams
74,Section_5,Adam Schiff,Did you listen in on that call?,02:22,Vindman/Williams
75,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I did.",02:27,Vindman/Williams
76,Section_5,Adam Schiff,The White House has now released the record of that call. Did President Trump ever mention corruption in the April 21st call?,02:29,Vindman/Williams
77,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"To the best of my recollection, he did not.",02:40,Vindman/Williams
78,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"On the April 21st call, President Trump told President Zelensky that he would send a high level US delegation to the inauguration. Following that call, Ms. Williams was it your understanding that the president wanted the vice president to attend inauguration in Keiv?",02:45,Vindman/Williams
79,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,Yes. That was my understanding.,03:00,Vindman/Williams
80,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And did the president subsequently tell the vice president not to attend the inauguration?,03:02,Vindman/Williams
81,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,I was informed by our chief of staff’s office by the vice president’s chief of staff’s office that the president had told the vice president not to attend. I did not witness that conversation.,03:07,Vindman/Williams
82,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"And am I correct that you learned this on May 13th, is that right?",03:18,Vindman/Williams
83,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,03:25,Vindman/Williams
84,Section_5,Adam Schiff,Am I also correct that the inauguration date had not been set by May 13th?,03:26,Vindman/Williams
85,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,03:31,Vindman/Williams
86,Section_5,Adam Schiff,Do you know what accounted for the president’s decision to instruct the vice president not to attend?,03:31,Vindman/Williams
87,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,I do not.,03:41,Vindman/Williams
88,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Colonel Vindman, you were a member of the US delegation to the inauguration on May 20th, is that correct?",03:41,Vindman/Williams
89,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, chairman.",03:47,Vindman/Williams
90,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"And during that trip, did you have an opportunity to offer any advice to President Zelensky?",03:50,Vindman/Williams
91,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, chairman.",03:54,Vindman/Williams
92,Section_5,Adam Schiff,What was the advice that you gave him?,03:55,Vindman/Williams
93,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"During a bilateral meeting in which the whole delegation was meeting with President Zelensky and his team, I offered two pieces of advice. To be particularly cautious with regards to Russia and it’s desire to provoke Ukraine and the second one was to stay out of US domestic policy.",03:58,Vindman/Williams
94,Section_5,Adam Schiff,Do you mean politics?,04:27,Vindman/Williams
95,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Politics, correct.",04:28,Vindman/Williams
96,Section_5,Adam Schiff,Why did you feel it was necessary to advise President Zelensky to stay away from US domestic politics?,04:29,Vindman/Williams
97,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Chairman, in the March and April timeframe it became clear that there were actors in the US … Public actors, non-governmental actors that were promoting the idea of investigations and 2016 Ukrainian interference and it was consistent with us policy to advise any country, all the countries in my portfolio, any country in the world to not participate in US domestic politics. So I was passing the same advice consistent with US policy.",04:36,Vindman/Williams
98,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"I know Mr. Goldman will have more questions about that when I turn to him, but let me turn if I can to the hold on security assistance, which I think you both testified you learned about in early July. Am I correct that neither of you were provided with a reason for why the president put a hold on security assistance to Ukraine?",05:18,Vindman/Williams
99,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,"My understanding was that OMB was reviewing the assistance to ensure it was in line with administration priorities, but it was not made more specific than that.",05:40,Vindman/Williams
100,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And Colonel Vindman?,05:48,Vindman/Williams
101,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,That is consistent. The review was to ensure it remained consistent with administration policies.,05:48,Vindman/Williams
102,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Colonel Vindman, you attended a meeting in John Bolton’s office on July 10th where Ambassador Sondland interjected to respond to a question by senior Ukrainian officials about a White House visit. What did he say at that time?",05:58,Vindman/Williams
103,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"To the best of my recollection, Ambassador Sondland said that in order to get a White House meeting, the Ukrainians would have to provide a deliverable, which is investigations. Specific investigations.",06:15,Vindman/Williams
104,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And what was Ambassador Bolton’s response or reaction to that comment?,06:27,Vindman/Williams
105,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,We had not completed all of the agenda items and we still had time for the meeting and Ambassador Bolton abruptly ended the meeting.,06:33,Vindman/Williams
106,Section_5,Adam Schiff,Did you report this incident to the national security council lawyers?,06:44,Vindman/Williams
107,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I did.",06:48,Vindman/Williams
108,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Based on Ambassador Sondland’s remark at the July 10th meeting, was it your clear understanding that the Ukrainians understood they had to commit to investigations President Trump wanted in order to get the White House meeting?",06:50,Vindman/Williams
109,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"May have not been entirely clear at that moment. Certainly Ambassador Sondland was calling for these meetings and he had stated that he had this … This was developed per conversation with the Chief of Staff, Mr. Mick Mulvaney, but the connection to the president wasn’t clear at that point.",07:06,Vindman/Williams
110,Section_5,Adam Schiff,But the import of what Ambassador Sondland said during that meeting was that there was an agreement with Mick Mulvaney that Zelensky would get the meeting if they would undertake these investigations?,07:28,Vindman/Williams
111,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,07:41,Vindman/Williams
112,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"About two weeks after that July 10th meeting, President Trump and President Zelensky had their second call. The now infamous July 25th call. Colonel Vindman, What was your real time reaction to hearing that call?",07:44,Vindman/Williams
113,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Chairman, without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House council. I had concerns and it was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command.",08:01,Vindman/Williams
114,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And what was your concern?,08:20,Vindman/Williams
115,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Well, chairman, as I said in my statement, it was inappropriate. It was improper for the president to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there’s at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation and that would have significant implications if it became public knowledge and it would be perceived as a partisan play. It would undermine our Ukraine policy and it would undermine our national security.",08:23,Vindman/Williams
116,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Colonel, you’ve described this as a demand, this favor that the president asked. What is it about the relationship between the president of the United States and the president of Ukraine that leads you to conclude that when the president of the United States asks a favor like this, it’s really a demand?",09:07,Vindman/Williams
117,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"Chairman, the culture I come from the, the military culture. When a senior asks you to do something, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s not to be taken as a request. It’s to be taken as an order. In this case, the power disparity between the two leaders, my impression is that in order to get the White House meeting President Zelensky would have to deliver these investigations.",09:25,Vindman/Williams
118,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Ms. Williams, I think you described your reaction in your deposition when you listened to the call as you found it unusual and inappropriate, but I was struck by something else you said in your deposition. You said that it shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold. What did you mean by that?",09:57,Vindman/Williams
119,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,"Mr. Chairman, I was asked during the closed door testimony how I felt about the call and in reflecting on what I was thinking in that moment, it was the first time I had heard internally the president reference particular investigations that previously I had only heard about through Mr. Giuliani’s press interviews in press reporting.",10:21,Vindman/Williams
120,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,So in that moment it was not clear whether there was a direct connection or linkage between the ongoing hold on security assistance and what the president may be asking President Zelensky to undertake in regard to investigations. So it was noteworthy in that regard. I did not have enough information to draw any firm conclusions.,10:45,Vindman/Williams
121,Section_5,Adam Schiff,But it raised the question in your mind as to whether the two were related?,11:08,Vindman/Williams
122,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,"It was the first I had heard of any requests of Ukraine, which were that specific in nature. So it was noteworthy to me in that regard.",11:12,Vindman/Williams
123,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Both of you recall President Zelensky in that conversation raising the issue or mentioning Burisma, do you not?",11:24,Vindman/Williams
124,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,11:36,Vindman/Williams
125,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,11:36,Vindman/Williams
126,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And yet the word Burisma appears nowhere in the call record that’s been released to the public. Is that right?,11:38,Vindman/Williams
127,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,That’s right.,11:44,Vindman/Williams
128,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,11:45,Vindman/Williams
129,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Do you know why that’s the case, why that was left out?",11:46,Vindman/Williams
130,Section_5,Jennifer Williams,I do not. I was not involved in the production of that transcript.,11:49,Vindman/Williams
131,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,"I attributed that to the fact that this transcript that is being produced may have not caught the word Burisma and in the transcript that was released, it was released as accompany, which is accurate. It’s not a significant omission.",11:55,Vindman/Williams
132,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"Colonel, you pointed out the fact that that word was used, did you not?",12:17,Vindman/Williams
133,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,12:21,Vindman/Williams
134,Section_5,Adam Schiff,And the edit was not included in the record released to the public?,12:22,Vindman/Williams
135,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,That’s right. I’d say it’s informed speculation that the folks that produced these transcripts do the best they can and they just didn’t catch the word. And that was my responsibility to then make sure that the transcript was as accurate as possible. And that’s what I attempted to do by putting that word back in because that was in my notes.,12:27,Vindman/Williams
136,Section_5,Adam Schiff,"I think Colonel, you testified in your deposition that you found it striking that Zelensky would bring up Burisma. That it indicated to you that he had been prepped for the call to expect this issue to come up. What led you to that conclusion?",12:50,Vindman/Williams
137,Section_5,Alexander Vindman,It seemed unlikely that he would be familiar with a single company in the context of a call that was on the broader bilateral relationship and it seemed to me that he was either tracking this issue because it was in the press or he was otherwise prepped.,13:06,Vindman/Williams
138,Section_5,Devin Nunes,"Thank you, Ms. Williams. Welcome.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
139,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,Thank you.,00:02,Vindman/Williams
140,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"I want to just establish a few basic facts about your knowledge, Ukraine, Burisma and the role of the Bidens.",00:03,Vindman/Williams
141,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"Yes, sir.",00:11,Vindman/Williams
142,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"You spend an extraordinary amount of your time on Ukraine, correct? Ukraine is [crosstalk 00:00:15].",00:11,Vindman/Williams
143,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"Ukraine is one of the countries in my portfolio. I would not say an extraordinary amount of time, but certainly the vice president has engaged on Ukraine policy quite a bit in my eight months.",00:18,Vindman/Williams
144,Section_6,Devin Nunes,And it’s in your portfolio?,00:27,Vindman/Williams
145,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,00:28,Vindman/Williams
146,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"First off, were you aware in September of 2015 then, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt publicly called for an investigation and this ends it into Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma. Were you aware of these public statements?",00:32,Vindman/Williams
147,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"No, not at the time.",00:52,Vindman/Williams
148,Section_6,Devin Nunes,You are today though?,00:54,Vindman/Williams
149,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"I’ve since heard them, yes.",00:55,Vindman/Williams
150,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Did you know of anti-Trump efforts by various Ukrainian officials as well as Alexandra Chalupa, a DNC consultant?",00:58,Vindman/Williams
151,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"No, I was not aware.",01:06,Vindman/Williams
152,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Did you know about the deputy assistant secretary of state Kent’s concerns about potential conflict of interest into Hunter Biden’s sitting on the board of Burisma?,01:08,Vindman/Williams
153,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,I did not work on Ukraine policy during that timeframe. So I’ve become aware of it through [crosstalk 00:01:21].,01:17,Vindman/Williams
154,Section_6,Devin Nunes,In the last year or so?,01:21,Vindman/Williams
155,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,I’ve become aware of it through Mr. Kent’s testimony through this process.,01:23,Vindman/Williams
156,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Did you know that financial records show a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma routed more than $3 million to American accounts tied to Hunter Biden?,01:29,Vindman/Williams
157,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,No. I was not aware.,01:40,Vindman/Williams
158,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Until?,01:42,Vindman/Williams
159,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,Until [crosstalk 00:01:44].,01:44,Vindman/Williams
160,Section_6,Devin Nunes,You prepared for this hearing?,01:44,Vindman/Williams
161,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"Until others have been testifying in more detail on those issues, that’s correct.",01:46,Vindman/Williams
162,Section_6,Devin Nunes,You’ve been following it more closely?,01:50,Vindman/Williams
163,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,Correct.,01:53,Vindman/Williams
164,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Did you know that Burisma is American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after vice president Biden forced the firing of the country’s chief prosecutor?,01:55,Vindman/Williams
165,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"Again, sir, I was not working on Ukraine policy during that time.",02:05,Vindman/Williams
166,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Yeah [crosstalk 00:02:09] and I’m not, none of these are trick questions. I’m just trying to get through them on the record.",02:09,Vindman/Williams
167,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,I understand. Yeah.,02:11,Vindman/Williams
168,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Did you know that Burisma lawyers pressured the state department in February 2016 after the raid and month before the firing of Shoken, and that they invoked Hunter Biden’s name as a reason to intervene?",02:13,Vindman/Williams
169,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,I was not aware.,02:25,Vindman/Williams
170,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Did you know that Joe Biden called Ukrainian president Poroshenko at least three times in February 2016 after the president and owner of Burisma’s home was raided on February 2nd by the state prosecutor’s office?,02:27,Vindman/Williams
171,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"Not at the time. Again, I’ve become aware of that through this proceeding.",02:40,Vindman/Williams
172,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Thank you, Ms. Williams. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I’m going to ask you the same questions just to establish some basic facts about your knowledge about Ukraine, Burisma and the role of the Bidens. In September 2015 us ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt publicly called for an investigation into Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma. Were you aware of these public statements?",02:44,Vindman/Williams
173,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,I wasn’t aware of them at the time.,03:11,Vindman/Williams
174,Section_6,Devin Nunes,When did you become aware of them?,03:13,Vindman/Williams
175,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,During the course of the testimony and the depositions after this impeachment inquiry began.,03:15,Vindman/Williams
176,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Did you know of anti-Trump efforts by various Ukrainian government officials, as well as Alexandra Chalupa, a DNC consultant?",03:22,Vindman/Williams
177,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,I’m not aware of any of these interference efforts.,03:30,Vindman/Williams
178,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Did you know about deputy assistant secretary of state’s Kent’s concerns about potential conflict of interest with Hunter Biden’s sitting on the board of Burisma?,03:36,Vindman/Williams
179,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,The only thing I’m aware of pertains to his deposition.,03:44,Vindman/Williams
180,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Did you know that financial records show a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma routed more than $3 million to the American accounts tied to Hunter Biden.",03:50,Vindman/Williams
181,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,I’m not aware of this fact.,03:59,Vindman/Williams
182,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Until recently?,04:04,Vindman/Williams
183,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,I guess I didn’t independently look into it. I’m just not aware of what kind of payments Mr. Biden may received. This is not something I’m aware of.,04:06,Vindman/Williams
184,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Did you know that Burisma’s American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after vice president Biden forced the firing of the country’s chief prosecutor?,04:16,Vindman/Williams

189,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,I’m aware of the fact that president Biden or vice president Biden was a very engaged on Ukraine and had numerous engagements. That’s what I’m aware of.,04:57,Vindman/Williams
190,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Ms. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, as you may or may not know, this committee has spent nearly three years conducting various investigations starting with the Russia collusion hoax, Pfizer abuse, democratic hysteria over the lack of collusion and the Mueller report, and now this impeachment charade. One of the most concerning things regarding all of these investigations is the amount of classified or otherwise sensitive information I read in the press that derive either from this committee or sources in the administration.",05:05,Vindman/Williams
191,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"To be clear, I’m not accusing either one of you of leaking information. However, given that you are the first witnesses who actually have some firsthand knowledge of the president’s call by listening in on July 25th. It’s imperative to the American public’s understanding of the events that we get a quick few matters out-of-the-way first. Ms. Williams, let me just go to you first. For the purposes of the following questions, I’m only asking about the time period between from July 25th to September 25th.",05:43,Vindman/Williams
192,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,Okay.,06:21,Vindman/Williams
193,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Did you discuss the July 25th phone call between president Trump and president Zelensky or any matters associated with a phone call with any members of the press?,06:23,Vindman/Williams
194,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,No.,06:33,Vindman/Williams
195,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"To be clear, you never discussed these matters with the New York Times, the Washington Post, Politico, CNN, or any other media outlet?",06:35,Vindman/Williams
196,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"No, I did not.",06:42,Vindman/Williams
197,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Did you ask or encourage any individual to share the substance of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call with any member of the press?,06:44,Vindman/Williams
198,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,I did not.,06:53,Vindman/Williams
199,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Do you know of any individual who discussed the substance of the July 25th phone call or matter associated with the call with any member of the press?,06:55,Vindman/Williams
200,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"No, I do not.",07:03,Vindman/Williams
201,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, the same questions for you. Did you discuss the July 25th phone call between president Trump and president Zelensky or any matter associated with a phone call with any member of the press?",07:06,Vindman/Williams
202,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,I did not.,07:21,Vindman/Williams

207,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Do you know of any individual who discussed the substance of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call with any member of the press?,07:42,Vindman/Williams
208,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,We have an NSC press shop and they field any of these types of questions. I do not engage with the press at all.,07:51,Vindman/Williams
209,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Let me ask the question again. Do you know of any individual who discussed the substance of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call with any member of the press?,07:58,Vindman/Williams
210,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,"We have an NSC press shop whose job is to engage on any of these types of questions. I am not aware, but it is possible and likely that the press shop would field these types of questions.",08:11,Vindman/Williams
211,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Right, but the question is [crosstalk 00:08:27].",08:26,Vindman/Williams
212,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,I’m sorry.,08:27,Vindman/Williams
213,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"The question is, do you know any individual? Do you personally know any individual who discussed the substance of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call with any member of the press?",08:28,Vindman/Williams
214,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,Thank you ranking member for clarifying. I do not.,08:41,Vindman/Williams
215,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Thank you. Ms. Williams, did you discuss the July 25th phone call with anyone outside the White House on July 25th or July 26th and if so, with whom?",08:46,Vindman/Williams
216,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"No, I did not discuss the call with anyone outside or inside the White House.",08:59,Vindman/Williams
217,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Ms. Williams, during your time on the NSC, have you ever accessed a colleague’s work computer without their prior authorization or approval?",09:04,Vindman/Williams
218,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"I have not. And just to clarify, I’m in the office of the vice president, so not on the NSC.",09:12,Vindman/Williams
219,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Right, but representing the vice president?",09:17,Vindman/Williams
220,Section_6,Jennifer Williams,"No, I have not. No.",09:18,Vindman/Williams
221,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Thank you for that clarification. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, did you discuss the July 25th phone call with anyone outside the White House on July 25th or the 26th, and if so, with whom?",09:20,Vindman/Williams
222,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I did. My core function is to coordinate U.S. government policy, interagency policy, and I spoke to two individuals with regards to providing some sort of readout of the call.",09:33,Vindman/Williams
223,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Two individuals that were not in the White House?,09:48,Vindman/Williams
224,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,"Not in the White House, cleared U.S. government officials with appropriate need to know.",09:51,Vindman/Williams
225,Section_6,Devin Nunes,And what agencies were these officials with?,09:56,Vindman/Williams
226,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,"Department of state, department of state deputy assistant secretary George Kent, who is responsible for the portfolio, Eastern Europe including Ukraine, and an individual from the office of… An individual in the intelligence community.",10:00,Vindman/Williams
227,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"As you know, the intelligence community has 17 different agencies. What agency was this individual from?",10:20,Vindman/Williams
228,Section_6,Adam Schiff,"If I could interject here, we don’t want to use these proceedings.",10:28,Vindman/Williams
229,Section_6,Devin Nunes,It’s our time [crosstalk 00:10:33].,10:32,Vindman/Williams
230,Section_6,Adam Schiff,"I know, but we need to protect the whistleblower. [crosstalk 00:10:37]",10:34,Vindman/Williams
231,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Please stop.,10:38,Vindman/Williams
232,Section_6,Adam Schiff,"I want to make sure that there’s no effort to out the whistleblower through the use of these proceedings. If the witness has a good faith belief that this may reveal the identity of the whistleblower, that is not the purpose that we are here for and I want to advise the witness accordingly.",10:40,Vindman/Williams
233,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Mr. Vindman, you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistleblower.",11:01,Vindman/Williams
234,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,"Ranking member, it’s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please.",11:07,Vindman/Williams
235,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you testified in the deposition that you did not know who the whistleblower was, or is.",11:10,Vindman/Williams
236,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,"I do not know who the whistleblower is, that is correct.",11:20,Vindman/Williams
237,Section_6,Devin Nunes,So how is it possible for you to name these people and then out the whistleblower?,11:23,Vindman/Williams
238,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,"Per the advice of my counsel, I’ve been advised not to answer specific questions about members of the intelligence community.",11:30,Vindman/Williams
239,Section_6,Devin Nunes,Are you aware that this is the intelligence committee that’s conducting an impeachment hearing?,11:40,Vindman/Williams
240,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,"Of course, I am.",11:45,Vindman/Williams
241,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Wouldn’t the appropriate place for you to come to, to testify would be the intelligence committee about within the intelligence community?",11:47,Vindman/Williams
242,Section_6,Alexander Vindman,"Ranking member, per the advice of my counsel and the instructions from the chairman, I’ve been advised not to provide any specifics on who I’ve spoken to with inside the intelligence community. What I can offer is that these were properly cleared individuals or was a properly cleared individual with a need to know.",11:56,Vindman/Williams
243,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Well this is a… I mean, you can really, you can plead the fifth, but you’re here to answer questions and you’re here under subpoena. So you can either answer the question or you can plead the fifth.",12:17,Vindman/Williams
244,Section_6,Michael Volkov,"Excuse me. On behalf of my client, we are following the rule of the committee, the rule of the chair, with regard to this issue. And this does not call for an answer that is invoking the fifth or any theoretical issue like that. We’re following the ruling of the chair.",12:32,Vindman/Williams
245,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Counselor, what ruling is that?",12:54,Vindman/Williams
246,Section_6,Adam Schiff,"If I could interject. Counsel is correct. Whistleblower has the right, statutory right to anonymity. These proceedings will not be used to out the whistleblower. [inaudible 00:13:05]",12:56,Vindman/Williams
247,Section_6,Michael Volkov,"And I’ve advised my client accordingly and he’s going to follow the ruling of the chair. If there’s an alternative or you want to work something out with the chair, that’s up to you, Mr. Nunes.",13:06,Vindman/Williams
248,Section_6,Devin Nunes,"Well, we’ve attempted to subpoena the whistleblower to sit for a deposition. The chair is tabled that motion and then has been unwilling to recognize those motions over the last few days of this impeachment inquisition process. Oh, that’ll go to Mr. Castro.",13:18,Vindman/Williams
249,Section_6,Daniel Goldman,Good morning to both of you.,00:00,Vindman/Williams
250,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,Morning.,00:05,Vindman/Williams
251,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"On July 25th, at approximately 9:00 AM, you both were sitting in the situation room, probably not too much further away than you are right now. And you were preparing for a long awaited phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. Now, Colonel Vindman, in advance of this phone call, did you prepare talking points as you did for the April 21st call?",00:06,Vindman/Williams
252,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I did.",00:31,Vindman/Williams
253,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,What were those talking points based upon?,00:33,Vindman/Williams
254,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"This is not in the public record and I can’t comment too deeply, but the areas that we’ve consistently talked about in public, it was cooperation on supporting reform agenda, anti corruption efforts, and helping President Zelensky implement his plans to end Russia’s war against Ukraine.",00:39,Vindman/Williams
255,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"In other words, they’re based on official U.S. policy?",01:05,Vindman/Williams
256,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,01:08,Vindman/Williams
257,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And is there a process to determine official U.S. policy?,01:09,Vindman/Williams
258,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, that is my job is to coordinate U.S. policy, so throughout the preceding year that I had been on staff, I had undertaken an effort to make sure we had a cohesive, coherent U.S. policy.",01:14,Vindman/Williams
259,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And as you listened to the call, did you observe whether President Trump was following the talking points based on the official U.S. policy?",01:28,Vindman/Williams
260,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"Counsel, the president could choose to use the talking points or not, he’s the president, but they were not consistent with what I provided, yes.",01:39,Vindman/Williams
261,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Let’s take a look at a couple of excerpts from this call. Right after President Zelensky thanked President Trump for the United States’ support in the area of defense, President Trump asks President Zelensky for a favor and then raises this theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.",01:51,Vindman/Williams
262,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"He says in the highlighted portion, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it.”",02:16,Vindman/Williams
263,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, Colonel Vindman was this statement based on the official talking points that you had prepared?",02:37,Vindman/Williams
264,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,No.,02:45,Vindman/Williams
265,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And was this statement related to the 2016 Ukraine interference in the 2016 election a part of the official U.S. policy?,02:46,Vindman/Williams
266,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"No, it was not.",02:59,Vindman/Williams
267,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, at the time of this July 25th call, Colonel Vindman, were you aware of a theory that Ukraine had intervened or interfered in the 2016 U.S. election?",03:02,Vindman/Williams
268,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I was.,03:13,Vindman/Williams
269,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Are you aware of any credible evidence to support this theory?,03:14,Vindman/Williams
270,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I am not.,03:19,Vindman/Williams
271,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Are you also aware that Vladimir Putin had promoted this theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election?,03:21,Vindman/Williams
272,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I am well aware of that fact.,03:28,Vindman/Williams
273,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And ultimately, which country did U.S. intelligence services determine to have interfered in the 2016 election?",03:30,Vindman/Williams
274,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,It is the consensus of the entire intelligence community that the Russians interfered in U.S. elections in 2016.,03:39,Vindman/Williams
275,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Let’s go to another excerpt from this call where President Trump asked President Zelensky to investigate his political opponent, Vice President Joe Biden.",03:47,Vindman/Williams
276,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Here President Trump says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me” he said.",03:58,Vindman/Williams
277,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Again, Colonel Vindman, was this included in your talking points?",04:20,Vindman/Williams
278,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,It was not.,04:24,Vindman/Williams
279,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Is such a request to investigate a political opponent consistent with official U.S. policy?,04:25,Vindman/Williams
280,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,It was not consistent with the policy as I understood it.,04:32,Vindman/Williams
281,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Now are you aware of any credible allegations or evidence to support this notion that Vice President Biden did something wrong or against U.S. policy with regard to Ukraine?,04:38,Vindman/Williams
282,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I am not.,04:51,Vindman/Williams
283,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Ms. Williams, are you familiar with any credible evidence to support this theory of against Vice President Biden?",04:52,Vindman/Williams
284,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"No, I’m not.",04:58,Vindman/Williams
285,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, Ms. Williams, prior to the July 25th call, approximately how many calls between the President of the United States and foreign leaders had you listened to?",05:01,Vindman/Williams
286,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,I would say roughly a dozen.,05:12,Vindman/Williams
287,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Had you ever heard a call like this?,05:15,Vindman/Williams
288,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"As I testified before, I believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the president’s reference to specific investigations and that struck me as different than other calls I had listened to.",05:18,Vindman/Williams
289,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,You testified that you thought it was political in nature. Why did you think that?,05:31,Vindman/Williams
290,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations, such as former Vice President Biden and his son, struck me as political in nature, given that the former vice president is a political opponent of the president.",05:37,Vindman/Williams
291,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And so you thought that it could potentially be designed to assist President Trump’s reelection effort?,05:51,Vindman/Williams
292,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"I can’t speak to what the president’s motivation was in referencing it, but I just noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me.",05:58,Vindman/Williams
293,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Colonel Vindman, you said in your deposition that “it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the political benefits of the president’s demands.” For those of us who are not rocket scientists, can you explain what you meant by that?",06:07,Vindman/Williams
294,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"My understanding is that it was, the connection to investigate into a political opponent, was inappropriate and improper. I made that connection as soon as the president brought up the Biden investigation.",06:25,Vindman/Williams
295,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Colonel Vindman, you testified that President Trump’s request for a favor from President Zelensky would be considered as a demand to President Zelensky. After this call, did you ever hear from any Ukrainians either in the United States or Ukraine, about any pressure that they felt to do these investigations that President Trump demanded?",06:41,Vindman/Williams
296,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Not that I can recall.,07:13,Vindman/Williams
297,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did you have any discussions with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy here in Washington D.C.?,07:15,Vindman/Williams
298,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I did.",07:21,Vindman/Williams
299,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did you discuss at all the demand for investigations with them?,07:22,Vindman/Williams
300,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I did not.,07:26,Vindman/Williams
301,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Did you discuss at all, at any point, their concerns about the hold on security assistance?",07:27,Vindman/Williams
302,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"To the best of my recollection, in the August timeframe, the Ukrainian Embassy started to become aware of the hold on security assistance and they were asking if I had any comment on that or if I could substantiate that.",07:36,Vindman/Williams
303,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And that was before it became public, is that right?",07:53,Vindman/Williams
304,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,07:57,Vindman/Williams
305,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And what did you respond?,07:58,Vindman/Williams
306,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"I believe I said that… I don’t recall, frankly. I don’t recall what I said, but I believe it may have been something along the lines of, “I’m not aware of it.”",08:04,Vindman/Williams
307,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,You testified that one of your concerns about the request for investigations related to U. S. domestic politics was that Ukraine may lose bipartisan support. Why was that a concern of yours?,08:19,Vindman/Williams
308,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"Ukraine is in a war with Russia, and the security assistance that we provide Ukraine is significant. Absent that security assistance, and maybe even more importantly, the signal of support for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, that would likely encourage Russia to potentially escalate to pursue further aggression, further undermining Ukrainian sovereignty, European security, and U.S. security.",08:39,Vindman/Williams
309,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"So in other words, Ukraine is heavily dependent on United States support, both diplomatically, financially, and also militarily?",09:11,Vindman/Williams
310,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,09:20,Vindman/Williams
311,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Colonel Vindman, what languages do you speak?",09:22,Vindman/Williams
312,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I speak Russian and Ukrainian and a little bit of English.,09:24,Vindman/Williams
313,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Do you recall what language President Zelensky spoke on this July 25th phone call?,09:33,Vindman/Williams
314,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"I know he made a valiant effort to speak English. He had been practicing up his English, but he also spoke Ukrainian.",09:40,Vindman/Williams
315,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"I want to look at the third excerpt from the July 25th call. Chairman Schiff addressed this with you in his questioning, and you see in the highlighted portion, it says, “Specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.” Is that the portion of the call record that, Colonel Vindman, you thought President Zelensky actually said “Burisma”?",09:49,Vindman/Williams
316,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,10:16,Vindman/Williams
317,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And you’ve testified earlier that his use of, or his understanding that when President Trump mentioned the Bidens, that that referred to the company, Burisma, sounded to you like he was prepped or prepared for this call. Is that right?",10:17,Vindman/Williams
318,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,10:35,Vindman/Williams
319,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"I want to go to the next slide if we could, which is actually a text message that neither of you is on, but this is from Ambassador Kurt Volker to Andriy Yermak. Colonel Vindman, who’s Andriy Yermak?",10:40,Vindman/Williams
320,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Andriy Yermak is a senior advisor within the Ukrainian presidential administration. He’s a senior advisor to President Zelensky.,10:55,Vindman/Williams
321,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,… to Ukrainian presidential administration. He’s a senior advisor to President Zelensky.,11:03,Vindman/Williams
322,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, this text message is less than a half hour before the call on July 25th, and since neither of you are on it, I’ll read it. It says, from Ambassador Volker, “Good lunch. Thanks. Heard from White House. Assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck. See you tomorrow. Kurt.” Now is this the sort of thing that you’re referring to when you say that it sounded like President Zelensky was prepared for this call?",11:05,Vindman/Williams
323,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"This would be consistent, yes.",11:42,Vindman/Williams
324,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, turning to the fourth excerpt from the July 25th call where Ukraine’s President Zelensky links the White House meeting to the investigations that President Trump requests, Presidents Zelensky says, “I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington, DC. On the other hand, I also wanted to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation.” Colonel Vindman, when President Zelensky says, “On the other hand,” would you agree that he’s acknowledging a linkage between the White House visit that he mentions in the first sentence and the investigations that he mentions in the second sentence?",11:45,Vindman/Williams
325,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"It could be taken that way, but I’m not sure if I… It seems like a reasonable conclusion.",12:38,Vindman/Williams
326,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And if that is the case, that would be consistent with the text message that Ambassador Volker sent to Andriy Yermak right before the call. Is that right?",12:43,Vindman/Williams
327,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Seemingly so.,12:53,Vindman/Williams
328,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, you testified in your deposition that a White House visit, an Oval Office visit is very important to President Zelensky. Why is that?",12:56,Vindman/Williams
329,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"The show of support for President Zelensky, still a brand new president, frankly, a new politician on the Ukrainian political scene looking to establish his bonafides as a regional and maybe even a world leader would want to have a meeting with the United States, the most powerful country in the world, and Ukraine’s most significant benefactor in order to be able to implement his agenda.",13:08,Vindman/Williams
330,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,It would provide him with some additional legitimacy at home?,13:41,Vindman/Williams
331,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,13:44,Vindman/Williams
332,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Just to summarize, in this July 25th call between the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, President Trump demanded a favor of President Zelensky to conduct investigations that of you acknowledge were for President Trump’s political interest, not the national interest, and in return for his promise of a much desired White House meeting for President Zelensky. Colonel Vindman, is that an accurate summary of the excerpts that we just looked at?",13:46,Vindman/Williams
333,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,14:16,Vindman/Williams
334,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Ms. Williams?,14:17,Vindman/Williams
335,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,Yes.,14:18,Vindman/Williams
336,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Colonel Vindman, you immediately reported this call to the NSC lawyers. Why did you do that?",14:22,Vindman/Williams
337,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"At this point, I had already been tracking this initially what I would describe as alternative narrative, false narrative, and I was certainly aware of the fact that it was starting to reverberate, gain traction. The fact that it, in the July 10th call ended up being pronounced by a public official, Ambassador Sondland had me alerted to this, and I was subsequent to that report. I was invited to follow up with any other concerns to Mr. Eisenberg.",14:32,Vindman/Williams
338,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"We’re going to discuss that July 10th meeting in a moment. But when you say alternative false narratives, are you referring to the two investigations that President Trump referenced in the call?",15:08,Vindman/Williams
339,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,15:21,Vindman/Williams
340,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, at some point, did you also discuss how the written summary of the call records should be handled with the NSC lawyers?",15:24,Vindman/Williams
341,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"There was, following the report, there was a discussion in legal shop on the best way to manage the transcript, yes.",15:33,Vindman/Williams
342,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,What did you understand they concluded?,15:41,Vindman/Williams
343,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"My understanding is that this was viewed as a sensitive transcript, and to avoid leaks, and if I recall the term properly, or something along the lines of preserve the integrity of the transcript, it should be segregated to a smaller group of folks.",15:44,Vindman/Williams
344,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"To preserve the integrity of the transcript, what did that mean?",16:05,Vindman/Williams
345,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"I’m not sure I… I mean, it seems like a legal term. I’m not an attorney, but it was… I didn’t take it as anything nefarious. I just, I understood that they wanted to keep it in a smaller group.",16:08,Vindman/Williams
346,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"If there was real interest in preserving the integrity of the transcript, don’t you think they would have accepted your correction that Burisma should’ve been included?",16:20,Vindman/Williams
347,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"Not necessarily. The way these edits occur, they go through like everything else a approval process. I made my contribution. It was cleared by Mr. Morrison. Then when I returned it… Sometimes that doesn’t happen. There are administrative errors. I think in this case I didn’t see it, didn’t… When I first saw the transcript without the two substantive I had attempted to include, I didn’t see that as nefarious. I just saw it as, “Okay, no big deal. These might be meaningful, but it’s not that big a deal.”",16:29,Vindman/Williams
348,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,You said two substantive issues. What was the other one?,17:05,Vindman/Williams
349,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"There was a reference in a section… One second. Yeah, on page four, the top paragraph. Let me find the right spot.",17:08,Vindman/Williams
350,Section_7,Speaker 1,[inaudible 00:17:26].,17:26,Vindman/Williams
351,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Okay.,17:27,Vindman/Williams
352,Section_7,Speaker 1,[inaudible 00:17:29].,17:29,Vindman/Williams
353,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, you can look into it. Ellipse. There are videos-",17:29,Vindman/Williams
354,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,So-,17:36,Vindman/Williams
355,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,…if I recall-,17:36,Vindman/Williams
356,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,It’s-,17:37,Vindman/Williams
357,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,… or they’re recordings. Recordings.,17:37,Vindman/Williams
358,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Instead of an ellipses, it should’ve said to what you heard that there are recordings?",17:38,Vindman/Williams
359,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,17:44,Vindman/Williams
360,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did you ultimately learn where the call record was put?,17:47,Vindman/Williams
361,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"I understood that it was being segregated into a separate system, separate secure system.",17:53,Vindman/Williams
362,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Why? Why would it be put on a separate secure system?,18:01,Vindman/Williams
363,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"This is definitely not unprecedented, but at times, if you want to limit access to a smaller group of folks, you put it on the secure system to ensure that a smaller group of people with access to the secure system have it.",18:05,Vindman/Williams
364,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,But can’t you also limit the number of people who can access it on the regular system?,18:19,Vindman/Williams
365,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"You can do that, but to the best of my recollection, the decision was made, frankly, on the fly. After I conveyed my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg, Mr. Ellis came in. He hadn’t heard the entire conversation, and when it was mentioned that it was sensitive, it was kind of on-the-fly decision to just segregate it in this other system.",18:25,Vindman/Williams
366,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Ellis are the NSC lawyers?,18:48,Vindman/Williams
367,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,18:51,Vindman/Williams
368,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"But it was your understanding that it was not a mistake to put it on the highly classified system, is that right?",18:52,Vindman/Williams
369,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I’m not sure I understand.,18:58,Vindman/Williams
370,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Was it intended to be put on the highly classified system by the lawyers, or was it a mistake that it was put there?",19:00,Vindman/Williams
371,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"I think it was intended, but again, it was intended to prevent leaks and to limit access.",19:07,Vindman/Williams
372,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, you testified, both of you, about the April 21st call a little earlier, and Colonel Vindman, you indicated that you did include in your talking points the idea of Ukraine rooting out corruption but that President Trump did not mention corruption. I want to go to the White House readout from the April 21st call. At the… I’m not going to read the whole thing, but do you see the highlighted portion where it says “root out corruption”?",19:13,Vindman/Williams
373,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,19:47,Vindman/Williams
374,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"In the end, this readout was false. Is that right?",19:48,Vindman/Williams
375,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"Maybe that’s a bit of a… It’s not entirely accurate, but I’m not sure if I would describe it as false. It was consistent with US policy, and these items are used as messaging tools also, so a statement that goes out, in addition to reading out the meeting itself is also a messaging platform to indicate what is important with regards to US policy.",19:52,Vindman/Williams
376,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"So it is a part of US official policy that Ukraine should root out corruption even if President Trump did not mention it in that April 21st phone call, is that right?",20:22,Vindman/Williams
377,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Certainly.,20:32,Vindman/Williams
378,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"He also did not mention it in the July 25th phone call, is that right?",20:33,Vindman/Williams
379,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,20:37,Vindman/Williams
380,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Even though it was included in his talking points for the April 21st call, and presumably even though you can’t talk about it for the July 21st call, it was not included in either. Is that right?",20:39,Vindman/Williams
381,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,For the April 21st call-,20:54,Vindman/Williams
382,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"You did not mention it in either, rather.",20:56,Vindman/Williams
383,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,20:58,Vindman/Williams
384,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"When the President says now that he held up security assistance because he was concerned about rooting out corruption in Ukraine, that concern was not expressed in the two phone conversations that he had with President Zelensky earlier this year. Is that right?",20:59,Vindman/Williams
385,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,21:16,Vindman/Williams
386,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now, Ms. Williams, you testified that earlier that after this April 21st call, President Trump asked Vice President Pence to attend President Zelensky’s inauguration. Is that right?",21:19,Vindman/Williams
387,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,21:32,Vindman/Williams
388,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And that on May 13th, you were just informed by the Chief of Staff’s office that Vice President Pence will not be going per request of the President. Is that right?",21:35,Vindman/Williams
389,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"That’s what I was informed, yes.",21:46,Vindman/Williams
390,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And didn’t know what had changed from April 21st to May 13th. Is that right?,21:48,Vindman/Williams
391,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"No, not in terms of that decision.",21:56,Vindman/Williams
392,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Well, Colonel Vindman, since you in particular-",21:57,Vindman/Williams
393,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Well, Colonel Vindman, since you in particular a little bit more perhaps than Ms. Williams who has a broader portfolio focuses on Ukraine, I want to ask you if you were aware of the following things that happen from April 21st to May 13th. Were you aware that Ambassador Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled from Ukraine in that time?",22:03,Vindman/Williams
394,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,22:22,Vindman/Williams
395,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Were you aware that President Trump-,22:22,Vindman/Williams
396,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"I’m sorry to correct it, so she was a recalled prior … let me see. So, the notification occurred towards the end of April and she was finally recalled in May timeframe, I think May 20th if I recall correctly.",22:24,Vindman/Williams
397,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,So she learned about it after April 21st on April 24th. Is that right?,22:39,Vindman/Williams
398,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,22:43,Vindman/Williams
399,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And were you aware that President Trump had a telephone call with President Putin during this time period in early May?,22:44,Vindman/Williams
400,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I was.,22:51,Vindman/Williams
401,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And were you aware that Rudy Giuliani had planned a trip to go to Ukraine to pressure the Ukrainians to initiate the two investigations that President Trump mentioned on the July 25th call in this time period?,22:52,Vindman/Williams
402,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I was aware that he was traveling there and that he had been promoting the idea of these investigations.,23:08,Vindman/Williams
403,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"I want to move now to that July 10th meeting that you referenced, Colonel Vindman. What exactly did Ambassador Sondland say when the Ukrainian officials raised the idea of a White House meeting?",23:15,Vindman/Williams
404,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"As I recall, he referred to specific investigations that Ukrainians would have to deliver in order to get these meetings.",23:32,Vindman/Williams
405,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And what happened to the broader meeting after he made that reference?,23:43,Vindman/Williams
406,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Ambassador Bolton very abruptly ended the meeting.,23:51,Vindman/Williams
407,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did you have any conversations with Ambassador Bolton about this meeting?,23:57,Vindman/Williams
408,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"No, I did not.",24:02,Vindman/Williams
409,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did you follow Ambassador Sondland and the others to the ward room for meeting followup?,24:03,Vindman/Williams
410,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"There was a photo opportunity that we leveraged in order to demonstrate US support. So the White House visit demonstrated US support for Ukraine and the new national security advisor who was a technocrat. And then after that, we went down to a short post-meeting huddle or debrief.",24:11,Vindman/Williams
411,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Were the investigations, the specific investigations that Ambassador Sondland referenced in the larger meeting also discussed in the ward room meeting?",24:31,Vindman/Williams
412,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,They were.,24:39,Vindman/Williams
413,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,What did Ambassador Sondland say?,24:40,Vindman/Williams
414,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Ambassador Sonland referred to investigations into the Bidens Burisma in 2016.,24:42,Vindman/Williams
415,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"How did you respond, if at all?",24:48,Vindman/Williams
416,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I said that these requests to conduct these meetings was inappropriate. These investigations was inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security policy.,24:53,Vindman/Williams
417,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Was Ambassador Volker in this meeting as well?,25:05,Vindman/Williams
418,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I don’t recall specifically. I believe he was there for at least a portion of the time. I don’t recall if he was there for the whole meeting,25:08,Vindman/Williams
419,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Was this statement made in front of the Ukrainian officials?,25:16,Vindman/Williams
420,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"I believe there was some discussion. Prior to the Ukrainians leaving when it was apparent there was some discord between the senior folks, Ambassador Sondland and other White House staff, myself, they were asked to step out. So, I don’t recall if they were there for the entire discussion.",25:24,Vindman/Williams
421,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"The senior White House staff you’re referring to, does that include Fiona Hill, your immediate supervisor at the time?",25:47,Vindman/Williams
422,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,25:52,Vindman/Williams
423,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Now you said you also reported this incident to the NSC lawyers, is that right?",25:53,Vindman/Williams
424,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,25:58,Vindman/Williams
425,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,What was their response?,26:01,Vindman/Williams
426,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,John Eisenberg said that he took notes while I was talking and he said that he would look into it.,26:05,Vindman/Williams
427,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Why did you report this meeting and this conversation to the NSC lawyers?,26:13,Vindman/Williams
428,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"Because it was inappropriate and following the meeting, I had a short conversation following the post-meeting meeting in the wardroom. I had a short conversation with Dr. Hill. And we discussed the idea of needing to report this.",26:17,Vindman/Williams
429,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"So am I correct, Colonel Vindman, that at least no later than that July 10th meeting, the Ukrainians had understood or at least heard that the oval office meeting that they so desperately wanted was conditioned on these specific investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election?",26:35,Vindman/Williams
430,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,That was the first time I was aware of the Ukrainians being approached directly by a government official.,26:58,Vindman/Williams
431,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And directly linking the White House meeting to the investigations?,27:07,Vindman/Williams
432,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,27:11,Vindman/Williams
433,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Ms. Williams, you testified that in your opening statement that you attended the September 1st meeting between Vice President Pence and President Zelensky in Warsaw. Is that right?",27:17,Vindman/Williams
434,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,27:28,Vindman/Williams
435,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,What was the first thing that President Zelensky asked Vice President Pence about at that meeting?,27:30,Vindman/Williams
436,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,President Zelensky asked the Vice President about the status of security assistance for Ukraine because he had seen the political article and other news reporting that the security assistance was being held.,27:37,Vindman/Williams
437,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And you testified in your deposition that in that conversation, President Zelensky emphasized that the military assistance, the security assistance, was not just important to assist Ukraine in fighting a war against Russia, but that it was also symbolic in nature. What did you understand him to mean by that?",27:51,Vindman/Williams
438,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"President Zelensky explained that just equally with the financial and physical value of the assistance, that it was the symbolic nature of that assistance that really was the show of US support for Ukraine and for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I think he was stressing that to the Vice President to really underscore the need for the security assistance to be released.",28:13,Vindman/Williams
439,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And that if the United States was holding the security assistance, is it also true then that Russia could see that as a sign of weakening US support for Ukraine and take advantage of that?",28:40,Vindman/Williams
440,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"I believe that’s what President Zelensky was indicating, that any signal or sign that US support was wavering would be construed by Russia as potentially an opportunity for them to strengthen their own hand in Ukraine.",28:53,Vindman/Williams
441,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did Vice President Pence provide a reason for the hold on security assistance to the Ukrainian president in that meeting?,29:09,Vindman/Williams
442,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"Vice President did not specifically discuss the reason behind the hold, but he did reassure President Zelensky of the strongest US unwavering support for Ukraine and they talked about the need for European countries to step up and provide more assistance to Ukraine as well.",29:17,Vindman/Williams
443,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Did Vice President Pence report back to President Trump on that meeting? To your knowledge?,29:40,Vindman/Williams
444,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,"The Vice President conveyed to President Zelensky that he would follow up with President Trump that evening and convey to President Trump what he had heard from President Zelensky with regard to his efforts to implement reforms in Ukraine. I am aware that the Vice President spoke to President Trump that evening, but I was not privy to the conversation.",29:45,Vindman/Williams
445,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Are you also aware, however, that the security assistance hold was not lifted for another 10 days after this meeting?",30:05,Vindman/Williams
446,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,30:14,Vindman/Williams
447,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,And am I correct that you didn’t learn the reason why the holds was lifted?,30:16,Vindman/Williams
448,Section_7,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,30:22,Vindman/Williams
449,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Colonel Vindman, you didn’t learn a reason why the hold was lifted either, is that right?",30:23,Vindman/Williams
450,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,30:28,Vindman/Williams
451,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"Colonel Vindman, are you aware that the committee’s launched an investigation into Ukraine matters on September 9th two days before the hold was lifted?",30:30,Vindman/Williams
452,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I am aware and I was aware.,30:39,Vindman/Williams
453,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"And on September 10th, the intelligence committee requested the whistleblower complaint from the Department of National Intelligence. Are you aware of that?",30:40,Vindman/Williams
454,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,I don’t believe I was aware of that.,30:52,Vindman/Williams
455,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Were you aware the White House was aware of this whistleblower complaint prior to that date?,30:54,Vindman/Williams
456,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"The first I heard of the whistleblower complaint is I believe when the news broke, I was only aware of the committees investigating the hold on security assistance.",31:01,Vindman/Williams
457,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,"So is it accurate to say, Colonel Vindman, that that whatever reason that was provided for the hold, including the administrative policies, which would support the security assistance, is that right to your understanding?",31:11,Vindman/Williams
458,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"I’m sorry, I didn’t understand that.",31:31,Vindman/Williams
459,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,I was just asking that the administrative policies of President Trump supported the security assistance. Is that your understanding?,31:33,Vindman/Williams
460,Section_7,Alexander Vindman,"So, the inter agency policy was to support security assistance for Ukraine.",31:42,Vindman/Williams
461,Section_7,Daniel Goldman,Thank you. I yield back.,31:49,Vindman/Williams
462,Section_7,Steve Castor,"Thank you, Ranking Member Nunes. The call transcript as published on September 25th is complete and accurate. Will both of you attest to that? Ms. Williams?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
463,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I didn’t take a word for word accounting.,00:12,Vindman/Williams
464,Section_8,Steve Castor,Of course.,00:14,Vindman/Williams
465,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"When I first saw the publicly released version, it looks substantively correct to me.",00:15,Vindman/Williams
466,Section_8,Steve Castor,And Colonel Vindman?,00:20,Vindman/Williams
467,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I certainly would describe it as a substantively correct.,00:22,Vindman/Williams
468,Section_8,Steve Castor,"I think in your testimony, your deposition, you said, “very accurate?”",00:25,Vindman/Williams
469,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,00:28,Vindman/Williams
470,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And you flagged a couple edits, Colonel Vindman I think you had Burisma on page four where President Zelensky was talking about the company mentioned in the issue?",00:29,Vindman/Williams
471,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I’m sorry, could you say that question again?",00:45,Vindman/Williams
472,Section_8,Steve Castor,"I believe in your testimony, you explained that you offered an edit that on page four of the transcript that was ultimately published you thought President Zelensky mentioned the word, Burisma.",00:47,Vindman/Williams
473,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Oh, I had it in my notes, I know that’s what he said, yes.",00:57,Vindman/Williams
474,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And Ms. Williams … and that was on page four, correct?",01:00,Vindman/Williams
475,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,01:03,Vindman/Williams
476,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And Ms. Williams, I believe after your deposition you went back and checked your notes and you had President Zelensky using the term, Burisma as well. Is that correct?",01:04,Vindman/Williams
477,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,01:14,Vindman/Williams
478,Section_8,Steve Castor,"But that came up on a different part of the transcript than what Colonel Vindman was relating to, correct?",01:16,Vindman/Williams
479,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"Yes, I believe so.",01:21,Vindman/Williams
480,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Yours came up on page five and it would’ve been in substitution for the word, case?",01:23,Vindman/Williams
481,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"That’s right, that’s where I have it in my notes.",01:27,Vindman/Williams
482,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. Colonel Vindman, we’ve had some discussion earlier today and also at your deposition about whether the President had a demand for President Zelensky. I suggested to you in the deposition that the President’s words are in fact ambiguous and he uses some phrases that certainly could be characterized as hedging. On page three, in the first paragraph he talks about whatever you can do, he talks about if that’s possible. On page four he mentions, “if you could speak to him” and you talk about the attorney general, Rudy Giuliani. And then at the end of the first paragraph on page four, he says, “whatever you can do,” the President also says, “if you can look into it.” And I asked you during your deposition whether you saw or acknowledged the fact that certain people could read that to be ambiguous.",01:29,Vindman/Williams
483,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"And I said correct, yes.",02:28,Vindman/Williams
484,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And I believe you said, “I think people want to hear what they have already preconceived.” Is that what you testified?",02:29,Vindman/Williams
485,Section_8,Speaker 1,"Actually, if I could ask for just a page site?",02:37,Vindman/Williams
486,Section_8,Steve Castor,256.,02:40,Vindman/Williams
487,Section_8,Speaker 1,"256 and a line, thank you. Just a minute, please.",02:41,Vindman/Williams
488,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Okay.,02:54,Vindman/Williams
489,Section_8,Speaker 1,"Okay, we got the page.",02:54,Vindman/Williams
490,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And then you went on to say, yeah, you agreed with me, you said, “Yeah, I guess you could interpret it different ways.” Is that correct?",02:56,Vindman/Williams
491,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,03:04,Vindman/Williams
492,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. Turning attention to the preparation of the transcript, that followed the ordinary process, correct?",03:04,Vindman/Williams
493,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"So I think it followed the appropriate process in terms of making sure that eventually it came around for clearances, for accuracy, but it was in a different system.",03:16,Vindman/Williams
494,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Well, I’ll get to that in a second, that that relates to the storage of it. You had some concerns. Mr. Morrison articulated his concerns about if the transcript was leaked out. And I think both you and Mr. Morrison agreed that it needed to be protected.",03:29,Vindman/Williams
495,Section_8,Speaker 1,"Just a correction, I don’t think it was Mr. Morrison. It was Mr. Eisenberg, right?",03:45,Vindman/Williams
496,Section_8,Steve Castor,Mr. Morrison testified at his deposition.,03:51,Vindman/Williams
497,Section_8,Speaker 1,"Okay, we don’t have that in front of us. If you can give us that, we’ll take a look.",03:53,Vindman/Williams
498,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I can say for myself, the concerns about leaks seemed valid and wasn’t particularly critical. I thought this was sensitive and I was not going to question the attorney’s judgment on that.",03:58,Vindman/Williams
499,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Right, and even on the codeword server, you had access to it?",04:13,Vindman/Williams
500,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,04:17,Vindman/Williams
501,Section_8,Steve Castor,So at no point in time during the course of your official duties were you denied access to this information?,04:19,Vindman/Williams
502,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,04:24,Vindman/Williams
503,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Is that correct? Ms. Williams, I want to turn to you for a moment. And you testified that you believed that transcript is complete and accurate other than the one issue you mentioned.",04:25,Vindman/Williams
504,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"Substantively accurate, yes.",04:44,Vindman/Williams
505,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Now, did you express any concerns to anyone in your office about what you heard on the call?",04:48,Vindman/Williams
506,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"My supervisor was listening on the call as well, so because he had heard the same information, I did not feel the need to have a further conversation with him about it.",04:54,Vindman/Williams
507,Section_8,Steve Castor,And you never had any concerns with anyone else in the vice president’s office?,05:02,Vindman/Williams
508,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I did not discuss the call further with anyone in the vice president’s office.,05:06,Vindman/Williams
509,Section_8,Steve Castor,So you didn’t flag it for the chief of staff or the vice president’s counsel or anyone of that sort?,05:09,Vindman/Williams
510,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"Again, my immediate supervisor, Lieutenant General Kellogg was in the room with me.",05:15,Vindman/Williams
511,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Right. And after the call, did you in General Kellogg ever discussed the contents of the call?",05:19,Vindman/Williams
512,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"We did not, no.",05:23,Vindman/Williams
513,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. Now in the run up to the meeting in Warsaw, the vice president was meeting with President Zelensky September 1st in Warsaw. You were involved with the preparation of the vice president’s briefing materials?",05:24,Vindman/Williams
514,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I was.,05:34,Vindman/Williams
515,Section_8,Steve Castor,And did you flag for the vice president parts of call that had concerned you?,05:36,Vindman/Williams
516,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"No, we did not include the call transcript in the [inaudible 00:05:46] briefing book. We don’t normally include previous calls in [inaudible 00:05:49] briefing books.",05:43,Vindman/Williams
517,Section_8,Steve Castor,"So just wondering if the concerns were so significant, how come nobody on the vice president’s staff at least alerted him to the issue that President Zelensky might be on edge about something that had been mentioned on the 7/25 call?",05:50,Vindman/Williams
518,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"Again, my supervisor had been in the call with me and I ensured that the vice president had access to the transcript in the moment on that day. As we were preparing for the September meeting with President Zelensky, the more immediate issue at hand was two days prior, the news had broken about the hold on the security assistance. So we were much more focused on the discussion that was likely to occur about the hold on security assistance for that meeting.",06:07,Vindman/Williams
519,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And to your recollection, you were in the meeting with President Zelensky and Vice President Pence?",06:35,Vindman/Williams
520,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I was.,06:40,Vindman/Williams
521,Section_8,Steve Castor,And Burisma didn’t come up or the Bidens or any of these investigations?,06:40,Vindman/Williams
522,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"No, it did not.",06:43,Vindman/Williams
523,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Colonel Vindman, you testified that the President has well standing or longstanding concerns about corruption in Ukraine, correct?",06:45,Vindman/Williams
524,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I don’t recall but there are concerns, there are broad concerns about corruption, yes.",06:54,Vindman/Williams
525,Section_8,Steve Castor,"But you would agree that if the U.S. is giving, hundreds of millions of dollars to a foreign nation that has a corruption problem, that’s certainly something that the U.S. government officials and the President would want to be concerned about?",06:59,Vindman/Williams
526,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,07:12,Vindman/Williams
527,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And if a foreign country has a problem with oligarchs taking money, taking U.S. tax payer dollars that’s something that the President ought to be concerned about in advance of dispensing the aid?",07:14,Vindman/Williams
528,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,07:25,Vindman/Williams
529,Section_8,Steve Castor,And I believe you did testify that corruption is endemic in Ukraine?,07:28,Vindman/Williams
530,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,07:32,Vindman/Williams
531,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Are you also aware of the President’s skepticism of foreign aid, generally?",07:38,Vindman/Williams
532,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I am.,07:45,Vindman/Williams
533,Section_8,Steve Castor,And it’s something that he’s made part of his priorities to make sure that U.S. foreign aid is spent wisely?,07:46,Vindman/Williams
534,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,07:52,Vindman/Williams
535,Section_8,Steve Castor,And you’re also aware of the President has concerns about burden-sharing among our allies?,07:54,Vindman/Williams
536,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,08:00,Vindman/Williams
537,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And with respect to Ukraine, he was very interested and engaged in seeing if there was a possibility for our European allies to step up and contribute more?",08:01,Vindman/Williams
538,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I think that would be in the context of a military assistance. In terms of burden-sharing, the European union provides over $15 billion.",08:11,Vindman/Williams
539,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay.,08:20,Vindman/Williams
540,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Has provided since 2014.,08:21,Vindman/Williams
541,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. But you are aware of the President’s concern of burden-sharing, right?",08:23,Vindman/Williams
542,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I am.",08:26,Vindman/Williams
543,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. Turning our attention specifically to the company Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, the co-founder of Burisma, it’s one of Ukraine’s largest natural gas producers, correct?",08:26,Vindman/Williams
544,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"That is my understanding, yes.",08:41,Vindman/Williams
545,Section_8,Steve Castor,And it’s been subject to numerous investigations over the years.,08:42,Vindman/Williams
546,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I’m not aware of … I guess I couldn’t point to specific investigations, but there is what I would call a pattern of questionable dealings and questions about corruption.",08:47,Vindman/Williams
547,Section_8,Steve Castor,Zlochevsky had served as the minister of ecology during President Yanukovych’s tenure?,09:01,Vindman/Williams
548,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I came to learn that that is correct, yes.",09:07,Vindman/Williams
549,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And are you aware, and George Kent testified a little bit about this last week, that under the Obama administration, the U.S. government encouraged Ukraine to investigate whether Zlochevsky used his government position to grant himself or Burisma exploration licenses, are you aware of that?",09:09,Vindman/Williams
550,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I would defer to George Kent, he’s a fount of knowledge on Ukraine, much deeper knowledge than I have. If he attested to that, then I’d take his word for it.",09:29,Vindman/Williams
551,Section_8,Steve Castor,And he testified that the U.S. along with the United Kingdom was engaged in trying to recoup about 23 million in taxpayer dollars from Zlochevsky and the Burisma entity.,09:40,Vindman/Williams
552,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I understand he testified that, yes.",09:51,Vindman/Williams
553,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. And Mr. Kent also testified that the investigation was moving along and then all of a sudden there was a bribe paid and the investigation went away. Did you hear him mention that?,09:52,Vindman/Williams
554,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I heard him mention that. These are events that occurred before my time. So frankly, beyond what he said, I don’t know much more.",10:07,Vindman/Williams
555,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Fair enough. Right around the time the bribe was paid, the company sought to bolster their board. Are you aware that they tapped some luminaries for their corporate board?",10:15,Vindman/Williams
556,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Certainly, I learned that at some point, yes.",10:29,Vindman/Williams
557,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Including the president of Poland, I believe.",10:31,Vindman/Williams
558,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,10:33,Vindman/Williams
559,Section_8,Steve Castor,And Hunter Biden?,10:33,Vindman/Williams
560,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I came to learn that as well.",10:36,Vindman/Williams
561,Section_8,Steve Castor,And are you aware of any specific experience Hunter Biden has in the Ukrainian corporate governance world?,10:37,Vindman/Williams
562,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I don’t know much about Mr. Hunter Biden.,10:45,Vindman/Williams
563,Section_8,Steve Castor,And we talked a little bit about at your deposition about whether Mr. Biden was qualified to serve on this board. And I believe you acknowledged that apparently he was not in fact qualified.,10:49,Vindman/Williams
564,Section_8,Steve Castor,I believe you acknowledged that apparently he was not in fact qualified?,11:03,Vindman/Williams
565,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"As far as I can tell, he didn’t seem to be. But like I said, I don’t know his qualifications.",11:04,Vindman/Williams
566,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. Ms. Williams, I want to turn our attention to the inaugural trip.",11:10,Vindman/Williams
567,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,Okay.,11:18,Vindman/Williams
568,Section_8,Steve Castor,"At one point, the Vice President and the Vice President’s office was focusing on attending that, correct?",11:19,Vindman/Williams
569,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,That’s right.,11:26,Vindman/Williams
570,Section_8,Steve Castor,"It’s somewhat complicated because as I understand it, the White House doesn’t want the President and the Vice President to be out of the country at the same time?",11:28,Vindman/Williams
571,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"Yes, that’s correct.",11:34,Vindman/Williams
572,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And during the timeframe, the President was in Japan. I believe he was in Japan, May 24th to 28th, and then he returned to Europe for the D-Day ceremonies June 2nd to 7th. And I think you told us that there was a window. You provided a four days at the end of May, that if the Vice President was going to attend the inauguration, it had to be the 29th, 30th, 31st, or 1st?",11:35,Vindman/Williams
573,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"Our embassy in Kiev had been in discussions with the Ukrainian… With President Zelensky’s team. And as we had learned, obviously the Ukrainian parliament was not going to come back into session until mid-May, and so we wouldn’t know formally what the date would be. But we understood that the initial thinking was that they were looking at dates at the end of May. And so honing in on that timeframe, we were aware of President Trump’s plan to travel on either end. So that’s why we advised the Ukrainians that if Vice President Pence were to be able to participate, the only really available days would be May 30th, May 31st, or June 1st.",12:03,Vindman/Williams
574,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And before the Vice President travels to a foreign nation, you have to send the Secret Service, do advance work, book hotels. It’s a relatively involved preparation experience, right?",12:41,Vindman/Williams
575,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,12:54,Vindman/Williams
576,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Do you know if the Secret Service ever deployed, booked hotels or anything of that sort?",12:55,Vindman/Williams
577,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"My understanding is that our advanced team was looking into those preparations, including hotel availability. And we were trying to determine when it would be appropriate to send out Secret Service and other advanced personnel in order to lay groundwork for a trip. But because we weren’t sure yet when the date would be, we hesitated to send those officials out.",13:00,Vindman/Williams
578,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. But ultimately, the Secret Service, as I understand it, did not deploy.",13:23,Vindman/Williams
579,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I don’t believe they did. No.,13:25,Vindman/Williams
580,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And President Zelensky’s inauguration was May 20th, if I’m not mistaken?",13:26,Vindman/Williams
581,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"Yes, that’s correct.",13:32,Vindman/Williams
582,Section_8,Steve Castor,And you had about four days notice?,13:32,Vindman/Williams
583,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"In the end, the Ukrainian parliament decided on May 16th to set the date for May 20th. That’s correct.",13:34,Vindman/Williams
584,Section_8,Steve Castor,"So you would acknowledge that that made it quite difficult for the Vice President and the whole operation to mobilize and get over to Ukraine, correct?",13:40,Vindman/Williams
585,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"It would have been, but we had already stopped the trip planning by that point.",13:48,Vindman/Williams
586,Section_8,Steve Castor,When did that happen?,13:51,Vindman/Williams
587,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,Stopping the trip planning?,13:53,Vindman/Williams
588,Section_8,Steve Castor,Yeah.,13:54,Vindman/Williams
589,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,On May 13th.,13:54,Vindman/Williams
590,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. How did you hear about that?,13:55,Vindman/Williams
591,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I was called by a colleague in the Vice President’s Chief of Staff’s office and told to stop the trip planning.,13:57,Vindman/Williams
592,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. As I understand it, it was the assistant to the chief of staff?",14:04,Vindman/Williams
593,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,14:08,Vindman/Williams
594,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. So you didn’t hear about it from General Kellogg, or the chief of staff, or-",14:09,Vindman/Williams
595,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,Correct.,14:13,Vindman/Williams
596,Section_8,Steve Castor,"… the President, or the Vice President?",14:14,Vindman/Williams
597,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,Right.,14:14,Vindman/Williams
598,Section_8,Steve Castor,You heard about it from Mr. Short’s assistant.,14:15,Vindman/Williams
599,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,That’s right.,14:19,Vindman/Williams
600,Section_8,Steve Castor,Did you have any knowledge of the reasoning for stopping the trip?,14:21,Vindman/Williams
601,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I asked my colleague why we should stop trip planning and why the Vice President would not be attending. And I was informed that the President had decided the Vice President would not attend the inauguration.,14:26,Vindman/Williams
602,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. But do you know why the President decided?,14:36,Vindman/Williams
603,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"No, she did not have that information.",14:39,Vindman/Williams
604,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And ultimately, the Vice President went to Canada for a USMCA event-",14:41,Vindman/Williams
605,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,That’s right.,14:47,Vindman/Williams
606,Section_8,Steve Castor,"… during this window of time, correct?",14:48,Vindman/Williams
607,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,Correct.,14:51,Vindman/Williams
608,Section_8,Steve Castor,"So it’s entirely conceivable that the President decided that he wanted the Vice President to go to Canada on behalf of USMCA instead of doing anything else, correct?",14:52,Vindman/Williams
609,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I’m really not in a position to speculate what the motivations were behind the President’s decision.,15:03,Vindman/Williams
610,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Well, you know the Vice President’s done quite a bit of USMCA events, correct?",15:07,Vindman/Williams
611,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"Absolutely. Yes, sir.",15:10,Vindman/Williams
612,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. Are you aware of whether anyone at the State Department inquired with your office about the Vice President’s availability for the trip to Canada?,15:11,Vindman/Williams
613,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,For the trip… At what point?,15:22,Vindman/Williams
614,Section_8,Steve Castor,Early May. Maybe May 8th.,15:24,Vindman/Williams
615,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I was not involved in the trip planning for Canada. One of my colleagues who covers Western hemisphere was in charge of that.,15:29,Vindman/Williams
616,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay.,15:34,Vindman/Williams
617,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,"So I’m not aware of specific requests about the Vice President’s availability. I was aware, from my colleague who was planning that trip, that we had competing trips potentially for the same window. But I was told that the Ukraine trip would take priority.",15:34,Vindman/Williams
618,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. But ultimately, you don’t know.",15:49,Vindman/Williams
619,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I don’t know about the Canada trip or?,15:52,Vindman/Williams
620,Section_8,Steve Castor,You don’t know the reason as to why the Vice President was sent to Canada for a USMCA event instead of going to the Ukraine?,15:54,Vindman/Williams
621,Section_8,Jennifer Williams,I would say I don’t know the reason behind why the President directed the Vice President not to go to Ukraine. I can’t speak to the motivations about the Canada trip.,16:02,Vindman/Williams
622,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. Colonel Vindman, I’d like to turn a little bit to the July 10th meeting in Ambassador Bolton’s office, and the subsequent post-meeting in the ward room. Who all was in the July 10th meeting, to the best of your recollection?",16:11,Vindman/Williams
623,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Are we talking about the ward room or are we talking about the actual meeting with Ambassador Bolton?,16:31,Vindman/Williams
624,Section_8,Steve Castor,We’ll start with the first meeting in the Ambassador’s office.,16:36,Vindman/Williams
625,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"So from the US side, we had Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, I believe there was another, a special assistant to the President, Wells Griffith was in there, and myself. From the Ukrainians-",16:39,Vindman/Williams
626,Section_8,Steve Castor,Who from the Ukrainians? Sorry.,16:57,Vindman/Williams
627,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"For the Ukrainian side, we had Oleksandr Danylyuk, Andriy Yermak, and I think Oleksandr Danylyuk’s advisor, Oleksii Semeniy.",16:59,Vindman/Williams
628,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. You testified that you couldn’t recall exactly why Ambassador Bolton stopped the meeting short, and you only learned it subsequently in talking to Dr. Fiona Hill?",17:14,Vindman/Williams
629,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I noted that it ended abruptly, but frankly, I didn’t exactly know why.",17:26,Vindman/Williams
630,Section_8,Steve Castor,"In the Bolton meeting, you don’t remember Ambassador Sondland using the word “Biden”?",17:36,Vindman/Williams
631,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"He did not. To the best of my recollection, I don’t think he did.",17:42,Vindman/Williams
632,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And then the group decamped to take a photo, correct?",17:46,Vindman/Williams
633,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,17:50,Vindman/Williams
634,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. So the general feeling of the group was a positive one at that time, even though it may have ended abruptly.",17:50,Vindman/Williams
635,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I think Ambassador Bolton was exceptionally qualified. He understood the strategic communications opportunity of having a photo. And we prompted him to, before we completely adjourned, to see if he was willing to do a photo. And he did.",17:57,Vindman/Williams
636,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. So you went out to West Executive Ave or wherever in the White House, and you took a photo. I think you said you took it?",18:15,Vindman/Williams
637,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I certainly took a couple of them, yes.",18:20,Vindman/Williams
638,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay.,18:22,Vindman/Williams
639,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,That’s right.,18:22,Vindman/Williams
640,Section_8,Steve Castor,"In the photo is Secretary Perry, Ambassador Bolton, Ambassador Volker-",18:23,Vindman/Williams
641,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,That’s right. Yeah.,18:28,Vindman/Williams
642,Section_8,Steve Castor,"… Mr. Danylyuk, and Mr. Yermak?",18:29,Vindman/Williams
643,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Yes. And I apologize. When I was running through the US side, of course, Ambassador Bolton, Volker, and Sondland were there, and Secretary Perry was there.",18:32,Vindman/Williams
644,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. Now, you testified that before the July 10th meeting, you had developed concerns about the narrative involving Rudy Giuliani. Is that correct?",18:40,Vindman/Williams
645,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,18:53,Vindman/Williams
646,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And had you heard a firsthand account from anyone on the inside, or you just been following news accounts?",18:53,Vindman/Williams
647,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I certainly was following news accounts, and that’s from the Ukrainian side, Ukrainian press and US press.",19:02,Vindman/Williams
648,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. And then-,19:09,Vindman/Williams
649,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"And my colleagues in the inner agency also were concerned about this, as this had started in the March timeframe, kind of emanating from the John Solomon story all the way through. So there had been ongoing conversations. So several different sources, Counsel.",19:11,Vindman/Williams
650,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. So when Ambassador Sondland mentioned the investigations, you sort of had a little bit of a clue of what the issue was?",19:26,Vindman/Williams
651,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Definitely.,19:37,Vindman/Williams
652,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And then you took the photo, a very nice photo, and then you went to the ward room?",19:38,Vindman/Williams
653,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,19:43,Vindman/Williams
654,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Do you remember… I think you conceded to us that you had a hard time remembering exactly what was said in the ward room. Again, it’s four months ago. It’s hard to be precise about whether Sondland… What specific words he used, whether he used Burisma, 2016 investigations. Is-",19:44,Vindman/Williams
655,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Yeah. So I believe it’s in the deposition, the three elements, Burisma, Bidens, and the 2016 elections were all mentioned.",20:02,Vindman/Williams
656,Section_8,Steve Castor,In the ward room?,20:11,Vindman/Williams
657,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,20:12,Vindman/Williams
658,Section_8,Steve Castor,"I think we can maybe go back to this, but I think on page 64 of your testimony, you told us that you don’t remember him using “2016” in the ward room?",20:15,Vindman/Williams
659,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I believe that I actually followed up. Because this question was asked multiple times. I said all three elements were in there, so-",20:27,Vindman/Williams
660,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay.,20:36,Vindman/Williams
661,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,… maybe picked out a point where I could-,20:36,Vindman/Williams
662,Section_8,Steve Castor,"When we asked the question, it sort of refreshed your recollection?",20:37,Vindman/Williams
663,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, I guess that’s a term now.",20:41,Vindman/Williams
664,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. There was some discussion of whether when Mr. Morrison took over the portfolio for Dr. Hill, whether you were sidelined at all. Did you feel like you were?",20:43,Vindman/Williams
665,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I certainly was excluded or didn’t participate in the trip to Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus at the end of August. Initially, before it changed from a POTUS trip to a Vice President trip to Warsaw, I wasn’t participating in that one. So I didn’t miss that. No.",21:04,Vindman/Williams
666,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. Did you express any concerns to Mr. Morrison about why you weren’t included on those trips?,21:30,Vindman/Williams
667,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Mr. Morrison… I was on leave. I was supposed to be on leave from the 3rd of August through about the 16th or so of August. And he called me and asked me to return. There was obviously high priority travel to the region. He needed my assistance to help plan for it, and asking me to return early from leave, which I take infrequently. I assumed that I’d be going on the trip. So when I was-",21:36,Vindman/Williams
668,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Frequently, I assumed that I’d be going on the trip. So after returning from leave early, when I was told I wasn’t going, I inquired about it, correct.",22:03,Vindman/Williams
669,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. And what feedback did he give you?,22:09,Vindman/Williams
670,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"He initially told me that the aircraft that was acquired, the MILAIR was too small and there wasn’t enough room.",22:12,Vindman/Williams
671,Section_8,Steve Castor,Had you ever had any discussions with Mr. Morrison about concerns that he or Dr. Hill had with your judgment?,22:24,Vindman/Williams
672,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Did I ever have any conversations with Mr. Morrison about it?,22:31,Vindman/Williams
673,Section_8,Steve Castor,Yeah.,22:34,Vindman/Williams
674,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,No.,22:34,Vindman/Williams
675,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. Did Mr. Morrison ever express concerns to you that he thought maybe you weren’t following the chain of command in all instances?,22:34,Vindman/Williams
676,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,He did not.,22:42,Vindman/Williams
677,Section_8,Steve Castor,And did Dr. Hill or Mr. Morrison ever ask you questions about whether you were trying to access information outside of your lane?,22:44,Vindman/Williams
678,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,They did not.,22:56,Vindman/Williams
679,Section_8,Steve Castor,And another aspect of the Ukraine portfolio that you were not a part of where some of the communications Mr. Morrison was having with Ambassador Taylor?,22:59,Vindman/Williams
680,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,23:10,Vindman/Williams
681,Section_8,Steve Castor,And did you ever express concern that he was leaving you off those calls?,23:10,Vindman/Williams
682,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Well, certainly it was concerning. He had just come on board. He wasn’t steeped in all the items that we were working on, including the policy that we’d developed over the preceding months. And I thought I could contribute to that, to the performance of his duties.",23:16,Vindman/Williams
683,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. You went to Ukraine for the inauguration, May 20th?",23:37,Vindman/Williams
684,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,23:43,Vindman/Williams
685,Section_8,Steve Castor,"At any point during that trip, did Mr Danylyuk offer you a position of defense minister with the Ukrainian government?",23:44,Vindman/Williams
686,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,He did.,23:49,Vindman/Williams
687,Section_8,Steve Castor,And how many times did he do that?,23:50,Vindman/Williams
688,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I believe it was three times.,23:52,Vindman/Williams
689,Section_8,Steve Castor,And do you have any reason why he asked you to do that?,23:54,Vindman/Williams
690,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I don’t know, but every single time I dismissed it. Upon returning, I notified my chain of command and the appropriate counterintelligence folks about the offer.",23:57,Vindman/Williams
691,Section_8,Steve Castor,"I mean, Ukraine’s a country that’s experienced a war with Russia. Certainly their minister of defense is a pretty key position for the Ukrainians. Presidents Zielinski, Mr Danylyuk to bestow that honor on you, at least asking you, I mean, that was a big honor, correct?",24:11,Vindman/Williams
692,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I think it would be a great honor, and frankly, I’m aware of service members that have left service to help nurture the developing democracies in that part of the world, certainly in the Baltics. Former officers, and if I recall correctly, it was an air force officer that became minister of defense. But I’m an American. I came here when I was a toddler and I immediately dismissed these offers. Did not entertain them.",24:28,Vindman/Williams
693,Section_8,Steve Castor,"When he made this offer to you initially did you leave the door open? Was there a reason that he had to come back and ask a second and third time, or was he just trying to convince you?",24:58,Vindman/Williams
694,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Yeah, Counsel, you know what? The whole notion is rather comical that I was being asked to consider whether I’d want to be the minister of defense. I did not leave the door open at all.",25:06,Vindman/Williams
695,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay.,25:18,Vindman/Williams
696,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"But it is pretty funny for a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, which really is not that senior, to be offered that illustrious a position.",25:18,Vindman/Williams
697,Section_8,Steve Castor,"When he made this offer to you, was he speaking in English or Ukrainian?",25:30,Vindman/Williams
698,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Oh, Mr Danylyuk is a absolutely flawless English speaker. He was speaking in English?",25:35,Vindman/Williams
699,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay.,25:39,Vindman/Williams
700,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"And just to be clear, there were two other staff officers, embassy key of staff officers, that were sitting next to me when this offer was made.",25:41,Vindman/Williams
701,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. And who were they?,25:49,Vindman/Williams
702,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"So one of them you may have met, it was Mr David Holmes, and the other one was… I don’t know, I mean, I guess I could… It’s another foreign service officer, Keith Bean.",25:52,Vindman/Williams
703,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. Yeah, we met Mr Holmes last Friday evening.",26:04,Vindman/Williams
704,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I understand. He’s a delightful fellow.,26:07,Vindman/Williams
705,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And you said when you returned to the United States, you papered it up given your… You know, with SCI clearance, whenever a foreign government makes a overture like that, you paper it up and you tell your chain of command?",26:13,Vindman/Williams
706,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I did. But I also don’t know if I fully entertained it as a legitimate offer. I was just making sure that I did the right thing in terms of reporting this.,26:27,Vindman/Williams
707,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And did any of your supervisors, Dr Hill at the time or Dr Kupperman or Ambassador Bolton, ever follow up with you about that? It’s rather significant, you know, the Ukrainians offered you the post of defense minister. Did you tell anyone in your chain of command about it?",26:35,Vindman/Williams
708,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"And I believe our Deputy Senior Director, John Erath, was there. Once I mentioned it to both of them, I don’t believe there was ever a followup discussion.",26:55,Vindman/Williams
709,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. So it never came up with Dr Kupperman or Dr Hill?,27:08,Vindman/Williams
710,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Following that conversation I had with Dr Hill, I don’t believe there was a subsequent conversation. And I don’t recall ever having a conversation with Dr Kupperman about it.",27:14,Vindman/Williams
711,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And did you brief Dr… Or, sorry, Director Morrison when he came onboard?",27:22,Vindman/Williams
712,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"No, I completely forgot about it.",27:27,Vindman/Williams
713,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. And subsequent to the did Mr Danylyuk ever ask you to reconsider? Were there any other offers?,27:29,Vindman/Williams
714,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,No.,27:38,Vindman/Williams
715,Section_8,Steve Castor,"When he visited for the July 10th meeting with Ambassador Bolton, did it come up again?",27:40,Vindman/Williams
716,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,It never came up again.,27:45,Vindman/Williams
717,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And did you ever think that possibly if this information got out, that it might create at least the perception of a conflict that the Ukrainians thought so highly of you to offer you the defense ministry post? You know, on one hand, but on the other hand, you’re responsible for Ukrainian policy at the National Security Council.",27:46,Vindman/Williams
718,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"So frankly, it’s more important about what my American leadership, American chain of command thinks than any of the… And these are honorable people. I’m not sure if he meant it as a joke or not, but it’s much more important what my civilian, White House National Security Council chain of command thinks more so than anybody else. And frankly, if they were concerned about me being able to continue my duties, they would’ve brought that to my attention. Dr hill stayed on for several more months and we could continue to work to advance US policy.",28:07,Vindman/Williams
719,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. And during the times relevant of the committee’s investigation, did you have any communications with Mr Yermak or Danylyuk outside of the July 10th meeting?",28:48,Vindman/Williams
720,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"I recall a courtesy note for Mr Yermak within days of his return to July, in which he wanted to preserve an open channel communication. And I said, “Please feel free to contact me with any concerns.”",29:01,Vindman/Williams
721,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And where are you following this… you know, there’s sort of two tracks. Ambassador Taylor walked us through it during his testimony last Wednesday. He called it a regular channel and then he called it an irregular, but not outlandish channel with Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker. Were you tracking the Sondland and Volker channel during this time period?",29:16,Vindman/Williams
722,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"Yeah, so I’m trying to recall at which point I became aware of Ambassador… Certainly I was aware of the fact that they were working together. Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker and Secretary Perry were working together to advance US policy interests that were in support of what had been agreed to. But I didn’t really learn, like I said, until the July 10th… Actually there might may have been a slightly earlier point. I recall a meeting in which Ambassador Bolton facilitated a meeting between Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Bolton in the June timeframe, and there may have been some discussion about this external channel. But I frankly didn’t become aware of these particular US government officials being involved in this alternate track until on July 10th.",29:39,Vindman/Williams
723,Section_8,Steve Castor,Okay. And I think we had some discussion that Mr Giuliani was promoting a negative narrative about the Ukraine and certain officials were trying to help the president understand that with Zielinski it was a new day and Ukraine is going to be different. Is that your understanding?,30:33,Vindman/Williams
724,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"That is correct. That is exactly what was being reported by the intelligence community, by the policy channels within the NSC, and the conservative voices of the various people that have actually met with him, including foreign officials.",30:49,Vindman/Williams
725,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And to the extent that you’re aware of what Ambassador Sondland’s goals were here and Ambassador Volker’s goals were here, you think they were just trying to do the best they could and try to advocate in the best interest of the United States?",31:02,Vindman/Williams
726,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,"That is what I believed and that is what I still believe, frankly.",31:18,Vindman/Williams
727,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And so to the extent Mr Giuliani may have had different views, they were trying to help him understand that it was time to change those views?",31:20,Vindman/Williams
728,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I think they were trying to bring him into the tent and have him kind of support the direction that we had settled on.,31:29,Vindman/Williams
729,Section_8,Steve Castor,And you never conferred with Mr Giuliani?,31:39,Vindman/Williams
730,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,No.,31:44,Vindman/Williams
731,Section_8,Steve Castor,"You never had any meetings, phone calls, or anything of that sort?",31:44,Vindman/Williams
732,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I did not.,31:47,Vindman/Williams
733,Section_8,Steve Castor,And did you have any-,31:48,Vindman/Williams
734,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I only know him as New York’s finest mayor.,31:48,Vindman/Williams
735,Section_8,Steve Castor,America’s Mayor.,31:51,Vindman/Williams
736,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,America’s Mayor.,31:52,Vindman/Williams
737,Section_8,Steve Castor,"And did you have any discussions, communications, during this relevant time period with the president?",31:54,Vindman/Williams
738,Section_8,Alexander Vindman,I’ve never had any contact with the president of the United States.,32:02,Vindman/Williams
739,Section_8,Steve Castor,"Okay. My time’s expired, Mr Chairman. Thank you.",32:04,Vindman/Williams
740,Section_8,Adam Schiff,"Want to ask you both about some of the questions you were asked by my colleagues in the minority. First, if I could ask you, Ms. Williams and Colonel Vindman, you were asked a series of questions by the ranking member at the outset. Were you aware of the fact that, and then there was a recitation of information about [inaudible 00:00:20], the Bidens. Is it fair to say you have no firsthand knowledge of any of the matters that we’re asking those questions?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
741,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,00:29,Vindman/Williams
742,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,00:29,Vindman/Williams
743,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"Ms. Williams, you were also asked a series of questions about the vice president’s schedule and whether he could have made the inauguration or was the president traveling or the trip to Canada. Let’s be clear about something. The president, you were instructed that the president had told the vice president not to go before you even knew the date of the inauguration. Is that correct?",00:34,Vindman/Williams
744,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,"Yes, that’s correct.",00:56,Vindman/Williams
745,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"So at the time he was told not to go, there was no calculation about where he might be or where the president might be because the date hadn’t even been set yet. Is that right?",00:57,Vindman/Williams
746,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,That’s right. The date had not been set. So we were weighing a number of different scenarios of when the inauguration might fall.,01:12,Vindman/Williams
747,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"Now I think you said that originally the president had told him to go and then you received the instruction that the president no longer wanted him to go. Were you aware in the interim between the president telling him to go and the president telling him not to go, that Rudy Giuliani had to abort a trip that he was going to make to Ukraine?",01:19,Vindman/Williams
748,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,"I had seen that in the press, yes.",01:39,Vindman/Williams
749,Section_9,Adam Schiff,And had you seen in the press that Rudy Giuliani blamed people around Zelensky for having to cancel the trip?,01:42,Vindman/Williams
750,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,For having to cancel his trip?,01:48,Vindman/Williams
751,Section_9,Adam Schiff,Yes.,01:50,Vindman/Williams
752,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,I had read that in their press reporting. Yes.,01:50,Vindman/Williams
753,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"And did you read the press reporting also that Giuliani wanted to go to Ukraine to, as he put it, “Not meddle in an election, but meddle in investigations?”",01:53,Vindman/Williams
754,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,"I did read that, yes.",02:04,Vindman/Williams
755,Section_9,Adam Schiff,And that occurred prior to the president canceling the vice president’s trip to the inauguration?,02:06,Vindman/Williams
756,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,It did. I believe it was around May 10th or so.,02:12,Vindman/Williams
757,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"Colonel Vindman, you were asked by the minority council about the president’s words on the July 25th call and whether the president’s words were ambiguous. Was there any ambiguity about the president’s use of the word Biden?",02:18,Vindman/Williams
758,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,There was not.,02:37,Vindman/Williams
759,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"It was pretty clear that the president wanted Zelensky to commit to investigating the Bidens, was it not?",02:39,Vindman/Williams
760,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:45,Vindman/Williams
761,Section_9,Adam Schiff,That is one of the favors that you thought should be properly characterized as a demand?,02:47,Vindman/Williams
762,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:54,Vindman/Williams
763,Section_9,Adam Schiff,And there’s no ambiguity about that?,02:55,Vindman/Williams
764,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,In my mind there was not.,02:58,Vindman/Williams
765,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"It’s also true, is it not, that these two investigations that the president asked Zelensky for into 2016 and into the Bidens were precisely the two investigations that Rudy Giuliani was calling for publicly, were they not?",03:01,Vindman/Williams
766,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,03:17,Vindman/Williams
767,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"So when people suggest, well, maybe Rudy Giuliani was acting on his own and maybe he was a freelancer or whatever, the president referred to exactly the same two investigations Rudy Giuliani was out pushing on his behalf. Is that correct?",03:18,Vindman/Williams
768,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,03:34,Vindman/Williams
769,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"Now, Ms. Williams, you were asked about the meeting. The vice president had with Zelensky in September in which the Ukrainians brought up their concern about the hold on the security assistance. Is that right?",03:37,Vindman/Williams
770,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That’s right.,03:52,Vindman/Williams
771,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"And you were asked about whether in that meeting between the Vice President Zelensky, the Bidens or Burisma came up and I think you said they did not. Correct?",03:53,Vindman/Williams
772,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct. They did not come up.,04:00,Vindman/Williams
773,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"Now that bilateral meeting was a large meeting that involved two or three dozen people, wasn’t it?",04:02,Vindman/Williams
774,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,It was.,04:09,Vindman/Williams
775,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"So in the context of this meeting with two or three dozen people, the vice president didn’t bring up those investigations, correct?",04:10,Vindman/Williams
776,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,"No, he did not bring up those investigations. He’s never brought up those investigations.",04:17,Vindman/Williams
777,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"Were you aware that immediately, and I mean immediately after that meeting broke up, Ambassador Sondland has said that he went over to Mr. Yermak, one of the top advisors to Zelensky and told Yermak that if they wanted the military aid, they were going to have to do these investigations or words to that effect?",04:21,Vindman/Williams
778,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,"I was not aware at the time of any meetings, side meetings that Ambassador Sondland had following the vice president’s meeting with President Zelensky. I’ve only learned that through Ambassador Sondland’s testimony.",04:43,Vindman/Williams
779,Section_9,Adam Schiff,So at the big public meeting it didn’t come up. And you can’t speak to the private meeting that was held immediately thereafter?,04:55,Vindman/Williams
780,Section_9,Jennifer Williams,Correct. The vice president moved on with his schedule immediately after his meeting with President Zelensky.,05:02,Vindman/Williams
781,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"Now Colonel Vindman, I want to go back to that July 10th meeting or meetings, the one with Ambassador Bolton and then the one in the wardroom that followed quickly on its heels. Were you aware that Ambassador Bolton instructed your superior Dr. Hill to go talk to the lawyers after that meeting?",05:08,Vindman/Williams
782,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,I learned shortly after she was finished talking to Ambassador Bolton and after we wrapped up with the wardroom that she did have a meeting with them and that’s what was expressed.,05:31,Vindman/Williams
783,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"Now you thought you should go talk to the lawyers on your own, correct?",05:44,Vindman/Williams
784,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,"That is my recollection, yes.",05:50,Vindman/Williams
785,Section_9,Adam Schiff,But Bolton also thought that Dr. Hill should go talk to the lawyers because of his concern over this drug deal that Sondland and Mulvaney were cooking up. Is that right?,05:54,Vindman/Williams
786,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is my understanding.,06:05,Vindman/Williams
787,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"And in fact, this drug deal, as Bolton called it, involved this conditioning of the White House meeting on these investigations that Sondland brought up. Is that right?",06:08,Vindman/Williams
788,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is my understanding.,06:22,Vindman/Williams
789,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"And in fact, this same conditioning or this same issue of wanting these political investigations and tying it to the White House meeting, this came up in the July 25th call, did it not? When the president asked for these investigations?",06:25,Vindman/Williams
790,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,06:43,Vindman/Williams
791,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"So the very same issue that Bolton said to Hill, “Go talk to the lawyers,” the very same issue that prompted you to go talk to the lawyers ends up coming up in that call with the president. Is that right?",06:44,Vindman/Williams
792,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,06:58,Vindman/Williams
793,Section_9,Adam Schiff,And it was that conversation that once again led you back to the lawyer’s office?,07:02,Vindman/Williams
794,Section_9,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,07:08,Vindman/Williams
795,Section_9,Adam Schiff,Now yield to the ranking member.,07:09,Vindman/Williams
796,Section_9,Adam Schiff,"Colonel Vindman, what was your realtime reaction to hearing that call?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
797,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,"Chairman, without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House council. I had concerns, and it was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command.",00:09,Vindman/Williams
798,Section_10,Adam Schiff,And what was your concern?,00:27,Vindman/Williams
799,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,"Well, chairman, as I said in my statement, it was inappropriate, it was improper for the president to request and to demand an investigation in to a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there’s at best, dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation. And that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge and it would be perceived as a partisan play. It would undermine our Ukraine policy, and it would undermine our national security.",00:30,Vindman/Williams
800,Section_10,Adam Schiff,"Now, Colonel, you’ve described this as a demand, this favor that the president asked. What is it about the relationship between the President of the United States and the President of Ukraine that leads you to conclude that when the President of the United States asks a favor like this, it’s really a demand?",01:14,Vindman/Williams
801,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,"Chairman, the culture I come from, the military culture, when a senior asks you to do something, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s not to be taken as a request. It’s to be taken as an order. In this case, the power disparity between the two leaders, my impression is that in order to get the White House meeting, President Zelinsky would have to deliver these investigations.",01:33,Vindman/Williams
802,Section_10,Adam Schiff,"Ms. Williams, I think you described your reaction in your deposition as, when you listened to the call, as you found it unusual and inappropriate. But I was struck by something else you said in your deposition. You said that, “It shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold.” What did you mean by that?",02:04,Vindman/Williams
803,Section_10,Jennifer Williams,"Mr. Chairman, I was asked during the closed door testimony how I felt about the call, and in reflecting on what I was thinking in that moment, it was the first time I had heard internally, the President reference particular investigations that previously I had only heard about through Mr. Giuliani’s press interviews in press reporting. So in that moment, it was not clear whether there was a direct connection or linkage between the ongoing hold on security assistance and what the President may be asking President Zelinsky to undertake, in regard to investigations. So it was noteworthy in that regard. I did not have enough information to draw any firm conclusions.",02:28,Vindman/Williams
804,Section_10,Adam Schiff,"Both of you recall President Zelensky in that conversation, raising the issue or mentioning Burisma. Do you not?",00:01,Vindman/Williams
805,Section_10,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,00:13,Vindman/Williams
806,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,00:13,Vindman/Williams
807,Section_10,Adam Schiff,And yet the word Burisma appears nowhere in the call record that’s been released to the public. Is that right?,00:15,Vindman/Williams
808,Section_10,Jennifer Williams,That’s right.,00:21,Vindman/Williams
809,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,00:22,Vindman/Williams
810,Section_10,Adam Schiff,Do you know why that’s the case? Why that was left out?,00:23,Vindman/Williams
811,Section_10,Jennifer Williams,I do not. I was not involved in the production of that transcript.,00:26,Vindman/Williams
812,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,"I attributed that to the fact that this transcript that is being produced, may have not caught the word Burisma. In the transcript that was released, it was released as the company, which is accurate. It’s not a significant omission.",00:32,Vindman/Williams
813,Section_10,Adam Schiff,"But Colonel, you pointed out the fact that that word was used, did you not?",00:54,Vindman/Williams
814,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,00:58,Vindman/Williams
815,Section_10,Adam Schiff,And the edit was not included in the record released to the public?,00:59,Vindman/Williams
816,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,"That’s right. I’d say it’s informed speculation that the folks that produce these transcripts do the best they can, and they just didn’t catch the word. And that was my responsibility to then make sure that the transcript was as accurate as possible. And that’s what I attempted to do by putting that word back in because that was in my notes.",01:04,Vindman/Williams
817,Section_10,Adam Schiff,"I think Colonel, you testified in your deposition that you found it striking that Zelensky would bring up Burisma. That it indicated to you that he had been prepped for the call, to expect this issue to come up. What led you to that conclusion?",01:27,Vindman/Williams
818,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,"It seemed unlikely that he would be familiar with a single company, in the context of a call that was on the broader bilateral relationship. And it seemed to me that he was either tracking this issue because it was in the press, or he was otherwise prepped.",01:43,Vindman/Williams
819,Section_10,Daniel Goldman,"Now, you’ve testified in your deposition that a White House visit, an Oval Office visit, is very important to President Zelensky. Why is that?",00:01,Vindman/Williams
820,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,"The show of support for President Zelensky, still a brand new president, frankly, a new politician on the Ukrainian political scene, looking to establish his bona fides as a regional, and maybe even a world leader, would want to have a meeting with the United States, the most powerful country in the world, and Ukraine’s most significant benefactor in order to be able to implement his agenda.",00:13,Vindman/Williams
821,Section_10,Daniel Goldman,It would provide him with some additional legitimacy at home?,00:46,Vindman/Williams
822,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,00:49,Vindman/Williams
823,Section_10,Daniel Goldman,"So just to summarize, in this July 25th call between the President of the United States and Ukraine, President Trump demanded a favor of President Zelensky to conduct investigations that both of you acknowledge were for President Trump’s political interest, not the national interest, and in return for his promise of a much desired White House meeting for President Zelensky. Colonel Vindman, is that an accurate summary of the excerpts that we just looked at?",00:50,Vindman/Williams
824,Section_10,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,01:21,Vindman/Williams
825,Section_10,Counsel,"I think we had some discussion that, you know, Mr. Giuliani was promoting a negative narrative about the Ukraine and certain officials were trying to help the President understand that with Zelensky, it was a new day and Ukraine is going to be different. Is that your understanding?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
826,Section_11,Alexander Vindman,"That is correct. That is exactly what was being reported by the intelligence community, by the policy channels within the NSC, and the conservative voices of the various people that have actually met with him, including foreign officials.",00:15,Vindman/Williams
827,Section_11,Counsel,"And to the extent that you’re aware of what Ambassador, you know, Sondland’s goals were here and Ambassador Volker’s goals were here, you think they were just trying to do the best they could and try to advocate in the best interest of the United States?",00:28,Vindman/Williams
828,Section_11,Alexander Vindman,"That is what I believed, and that is what I still believe, frankly.",00:42,Vindman/Williams
829,Section_11,Counsel,"And so to the extent Mr. Giuliani may have had differing views, they were trying to help him understand that it was time to change those views?",00:45,Vindman/Williams
830,Section_11,Alexander Vindman,I think they were trying to bring him into the tent and have him kind of support the direction that we had settled on.,00:54,Vindman/Williams
831,Section_11,Counsel,And you never conferred with Mr. Giuliani?,01:05,Vindman/Williams
832,Section_11,Alexander Vindman,No.,01:09,Vindman/Williams
833,Section_11,Counsel,"You never had any meetings, phone calls, or anything of that sort?",01:10,Vindman/Williams
834,Section_11,Alexander Vindman,I did not.,01:12,Vindman/Williams
835,Section_11,Counsel,And did you have any-,01:13,Vindman/Williams
836,Section_11,Alexander Vindman,I only know him as New York’s finest mayor.,01:14,Vindman/Williams
837,Section_11,Counsel,America’s mayor.,01:16,Vindman/Williams
838,Section_11,Alexander Vindman,America’s mayor.,01:18,Vindman/Williams
839,Section_11,Speaker 1,Thank you.,00:00,Vindman/Williams
840,Section_12,Jim Himes,"Thank you both for your testimony. Ms. Williams, you joined the foreign service in 2006, correct?",00:01,Vindman/Williams
841,Section_12,Jennifer Williams,Correct.,00:05,Vindman/Williams
842,Section_12,Jim Himes,"Prior to becoming a nonpartisan career official, you worked as a field representative for the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2004, and then you held a political appointment in the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Chertoff. Is that correct?",00:06,Vindman/Williams
843,Section_12,Jennifer Williams,"That’s correct, sir.",00:20,Vindman/Williams
844,Section_12,Jim Himes,"And now as a foreign service officer, you have served three presidents, two Republicans and one Democrat, in a variety of roles, correct?",00:20,Vindman/Williams
845,Section_12,Jennifer Williams,"Yes, sir.",00:28,Vindman/Williams
846,Section_12,Jim Himes,"And in your current position, you’re detailed from state to advise the Vice President on foreign policy towards Europe and Russia, correct?",00:29,Vindman/Williams
847,Section_12,Jennifer Williams,That’s right.,00:35,Vindman/Williams
848,Section_12,Jim Himes,"Ms. Williams, on Sunday, the President personally targeted you in a tweet. This is after he targeted Ambassador Yovanovitch during her hearing testimony. I’d like to show and read you the tweet. It reads, “Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read both transcripts of the presidential calls and see the just-release statement from Ukraine. Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know and mostly never even heard of, and work out a better presidential attack.”",00:36,Vindman/Williams
849,Section_12,Jim Himes,"Ms. Williams, are you engaged in a presidential attack?",01:05,Vindman/Williams
850,Section_12,Jennifer Williams,"No, sir.",01:08,Vindman/Williams
851,Section_12,Jim Himes,"Ms. Williams, are you a Never Trumper?",01:09,Vindman/Williams
852,Section_12,Jennifer Williams,I’m not sure I know an official definition of a Never Trumper.,01:13,Vindman/Williams
853,Section_12,Jim Himes,Would you describe yourself that way?,01:16,Vindman/Williams
854,Section_12,Jennifer Williams,"I would not, no.",01:17,Vindman/Williams
855,Section_12,Jim Himes,Did that tweet make an impression on you when you read it?,01:19,Vindman/Williams
856,Section_12,Jennifer Williams,It certainly surprised me. I was not expecting to be called out by name.,01:24,Vindman/Williams
857,Section_12,Jim Himes,"Which surprised me, too, and it looks an awful lot like witness intimidation and tampering, and an effort to try to get you to perhaps shape your testimony today.",01:29,Vindman/Williams
858,Section_12,Jim Himes,"Lieutenant Colonel, you previously testified that you’ve dedicated your entire professional life to the United States of America. Colonel, above your left breast, you are wearing a device which is a Springfield musket on a blue field. What is that device?",01:40,Vindman/Williams
859,Section_12,Alexander Vindman,It’s a combat infantryman’s badge.,02:00,Vindman/Williams
860,Section_12,Jim Himes,How do you get the combat infantry men’s badge?,02:02,Vindman/Williams
861,Section_12,Alexander Vindman,You have to be serving in a brigade and below a tactical unit. That means a fighting unit. Front line unit in combat.,02:05,Vindman/Williams
862,Section_12,Jim Himes,Under fire.,02:12,Vindman/Williams

874,Section_12,Jim Himes,"Colonel Vindman, multiple right wing conspiracy theorists, including Rudy Giuliani, have accused you of harboring loyalty towards Ukraine. They make these accusations based only on the fact that your family, like many American families, immigrated to the United States. They’ve accused you of espionage and dual loyalties. We’ve seen that in this room this morning.",03:21,Vindman/Williams
875,Section_12,Jim Himes,"The three minutes that were spent asking you about the offer made to make you the Minister of Defense, that may have come cloaked in a Brooks brothers suit and in parliamentary language, but that was designed exclusively to give the right wing media an opening to question your loyalties. And I want people to understand what that was all about. It’s the kind of thing you say when you’re defending the indefensible. It’s what you say when it’s not enough to attack the media the way the ranking member gave over his opening statement, or to attack the Democrats. But it’s what you stoop to when the indefensibility of your case requires that you attack a man who is wearing a Springfield rifle on a field of blue above a Purple Heart. I, sir, thank you for your service, and yield back the balance of my time.",03:42,Vindman/Williams
876,Section_12,Counsel,I want to move now to that July 10th meeting that you referenced Colonel Vindman. What exactly did Ambassador Sondland say when the Ukrainian officials raised the idea of a white house meeting?,00:00,Vindman/Williams

891,Section_13,Alexander Vindman,I I said that these requests to conduct these meetings was inappropriate. These investigations was inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security policy.,01:37,Vindman/Williams
892,Section_13,Counsel,Was Ambassador Volker in this meeting as well?,01:50,Vindman/Williams

902,Section_13,Counsel,Why did you report this meeting and this conversation to the NSC lawyers?,02:57,Vindman/Williams

904,Section_13,Counsel,"So am I correct Colonel Vindman that at least no later than that July 10th meeting, the Ukrainians had understood, or at least heard that the Oval Office meeting that they so desperately wanted was conditioned on these specific investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election?",03:20,Vindman/Williams

937,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,00:16,Vindman/Williams
938,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,You explained earlier in your testimony that your job within the white house was to coordinate United States and Ukraine policies. Is that right?,00:17,Vindman/Williams
939,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,It is to coordinate United States policy vis-a-vis Ukraine. Correct.,00:27,Vindman/Williams

942,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,What do you understand they meant by Mr. Giuliani’s “advances?”,00:46,Vindman/Williams
943,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,"I understood that to mean both his public commentary, so publicly calling for investigations into 2016 Burisma and Hunter Biden, as well as his direct overtures to the government of Ukraine directly and through proxies. That’s what I understood.",00:50,Vindman/Williams
944,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"As you understand it, under whose authority do you think Mr. Giuliani was acting under?",01:13,Vindman/Williams

948,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"Do you think that the Ukrainian officials that you spoke to understood the underlining meaning of, “Mr. Giuliani’s advances,” to be both investigating the Bidens as well as debunking the 2016 conspiracy theories?",01:36,Vindman/Williams
949,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,"Yes. I think to be clear, I think you’re referring to debunking that it was a Russian interference-",01:51,Vindman/Williams
950,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,Exactly-,01:59,Vindman/Williams
951,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,"… and how implicating themselves that it was Ukrainian interference, I’m not sure.",01:59,Vindman/Williams
952,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,Exactly. Now was this official US foreign policy to push for investigation into the Bidens?,02:03,Vindman/Williams
953,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,It was not part of any process that I participated in.,02:10,Vindman/Williams
954,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"Now, Ms. Williams, do you agree that pressing these two investigations was inconsistent with official US, Ukraine policy?",02:13,Vindman/Williams
955,Section_15,Jennifer Williams,Obviously anti corruption reforms is a big part of our policy.,02:23,Vindman/Williams
956,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,I a-,02:27,Vindman/Williams
957,Section_15,Jennifer Williams,I understand. I was not in a position to determine whether these particular investigations were appropriate.,02:28,Vindman/Williams
958,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,That’s fair.,02:33,Vindman/Williams
959,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"Colonel, is it true that president Trump directed the Ukrainian president on the call on July 25th to work with Mr. Giuliani on these investigations?",02:34,Vindman/Williams
960,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:45,Vindman/Williams
961,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"In fact, Mr. Giuliani has made no secret of the fact that he is acting on behalf of president Trump. As Mr. Giuliani told the New York Times, and I’m going to put this on the screen. He told them, “My only client is the president of the United States. He’s the one I have the obligation to report to, to tell him what happens.” He added that the investigations would be, “Very, very helpful to my client and may turn out to be helpful to my government.”",02:47,Vindman/Williams
962,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"Colonel, is it fair to say that the Ukrainian officials that you are on a daily basis, well you’re in contact with given your portfolio, were concerned about Mr. Giuliani’s advances?",03:15,Vindman/Williams
963,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,Yes. They were.,03:27,Vindman/Williams
964,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"In your assessment, did they understand the political nature of the request being asked of them?",03:28,Vindman/Williams
965,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,I believe they did.,03:29,Vindman/Williams
966,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,Did they understand that it was affecting US domestic policy?,03:29,Vindman/Williams
967,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,I’m not sure what they frankly understood about US [crosstalk 00:03:48]. I think they understood the implications. Yes.,03:43,Vindman/Williams
968,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,Now you testified earlier that you warned the Ukrainians not to get involved in US domestic policy. Is that right?,03:50,Vindman/Williams
969,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,"I counseled them, yes.",03:58,Vindman/Williams
970,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"Counseled them. In fact, you testified that you felt like it was important that you were espousing not just what you thought but, tradition and policy of the United States to say that?",04:00,Vindman/Williams
971,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,It is what I knew for a fact to be us policy.,04:16,Vindman/Williams
972,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,Now why do you think it’s important for foreign governments not to get involved in political affairs of a nation like United States?,04:19,Vindman/Williams
973,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,"Congresswoman, the first thought that comes to mind is Russian interference and interference in 2016. The impact that had on internal politics and the consequences it had for Russia itself.",04:27,Vindman/Williams
974,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,Exactly-,04:42,Vindman/Williams
975,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,This administration enforced heavy sanctions against Russia for their interference and that would not be in US policy to [crosstalk 00:04:54]-,04:42,Vindman/Williams

977,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,I understand ma’am.,04:57,Vindman/Williams
978,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"Is it normal for a private citizen, and non US government official, to get involved in foreign policy and foreign affairs like Mr. Giuliani?",04:57,Vindman/Williams
979,Section_15,Alexander Vindman,"I don’t know if I have the experience to say that, but it certainly wasn’t helpful and it didn’t help advance US national security interests.",05:07,Vindman/Williams
980,Section_15,Rep. Sewell,"Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.",05:14,Vindman/Williams
981,Section_15,Speaker 1,"So on corruption in Ukraine as Ambassador Yovanovitch testified, one of the key reasons why President Zelensky was overwhelmingly elected by the Ukrainian people was that they were finally standing up to ramp and corruption in their country. Would you both agree with the ambassador’s assessment?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
982,Section_16,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,00:15,Vindman/Williams
983,Section_16,Jennifer Williams,Yes.,00:15,Vindman/Williams
984,Section_16,Speaker 1,"And Ms. Williams, corruption was such a critical issue from your perspective that when you prepared the vice president for his congratulatory call with President Zelensky, you testify that the points you wanted to communicate on the call where the following, quote looked forward to seeing President Zelensky really implement the agenda on which he had run related to anti-corruption reforms. That’s correct.",00:16,Vindman/Williams
985,Section_16,Jennifer Williams,"That is, yes.",00:37,Vindman/Williams
986,Section_16,Speaker 1,"And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, would you agree that this focus on anti-corruption is a critical aspect of our policy towards Ukraine?",00:38,Vindman/Williams

988,Section_16,Speaker 1,"And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you are aware that in 2014 during the Obama administration, the first anti-corruption investigation, partnered between the US the UK and Ukraine was into the owner of the company Burisma.",00:46,Vindman/Williams
989,Section_16,Alexander Vindman,I’m aware of it now.,00:59,Vindman/Williams
990,Section_16,Speaker 1,"And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you testified that you were aware that Burisma had questionable business dealings. That’s part of its track record.",01:01,Vindman/Williams
991,Section_16,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,01:08,Vindman/Williams
992,Section_16,Speaker 1,"You also testified that regarding Burisma money laundering, tax evasion, comports with your understanding of how business is done in Ukraine. Is that correct?",01:09,Vindman/Williams
993,Section_16,Alexander Vindman,"I’m not aware of specific incidents, but my understanding is that it would not be out of the realm of the possible for Burisma.",01:18,Vindman/Williams
994,Section_16,Speaker 1,"Well, that’s page 207 from your testimony, but I’ll move on. You are aware that Hunter Biden did sit on the board of Burisma at this time?",01:25,Vindman/Williams
995,Section_16,Alexander Vindman,I am.,01:32,Vindman/Williams
996,Section_16,Speaker 1,"Well, I know that my constituents in New York 21 have many concerns about the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of the vice president, sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burisma. The Obama administration state department was also concerned, and yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call Hunter Biden despite our requests. Every witness who has testified and has been asked this has answered, yes. Do you agree that Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest?",01:33,Vindman/Williams
997,Section_16,Alexander Vindman,"Certainly the potential, yes.",02:04,Vindman/Williams
998,Section_16,Speaker 1,And Ms. Williams?,02:06,Vindman/Williams

1000,Section_16,John Ratcliffe,"Thank the gentlemen for yielding. In a press conference last Thursday, speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi said that president Trump committed the impeachable offense of bribery evidenced in his July 25th call transcript with president Zelensky. In concert with that, multiple democratic members of this committee gave TV and radio interviews over this past week discussing how the president’s conduct supported his impeachment for committing bribery.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1001,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"All of which struck me as very odd because for the longest time, this was all about quid pro quo according to the whistleblower complaint. But after witness, after witness began saying there was no quid pro quo, or even that quid pro quo was not even possible, we saw a shift from the Democrats. They briefly started to refer to the president’s conduct on the July 25th call as extortion. And now it’s shifted again last week to bribery.",00:31,Vindman/Williams
1002,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"Ms. Williams, you used the word “unusual” to describe the president’s call on July 25th. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman used the word “inappropriate” improper.” I’ve word searched. Each of your transcripts and the word “bribery” or “bribe” doesn’t appear anywhere in that. Ms. Williams, you didn’t. You’ve never used the word “bribery” or “bribe” to explain president Trump’s conduct, correct?",01:01,Vindman/Williams
1003,Section_17,Jennifer Williams,"Yes, sir.",01:35,Vindman/Williams
1004,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"Colonel Vindman, you haven’t either?",01:35,Vindman/Williams
1005,Section_17,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,01:37,Vindman/Williams
1006,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"The problem is in an impeachment inquiry or that the speaker of the house says is all about bribery, where bribery is the impeachable offense. No witness has used the word “bribery” to describe president Trump’s conduct, none of them. These aren’t all of the deposition transcripts. These are just the 10 that had been released.",01:40,Vindman/Williams
1007,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"Six weeks of witness interviews in this impeachment inquiry. Hundreds of hours of testimony, thousands of questions asked, thousands of answers given. The number of times that witnesses have been asked any question about whether or not president Trump’s conduct constituted bribery before ambassador Yovanovitch was asked by my colleague Congressman Stewart last Thursday is zero. The number of times witnesses have used the word “bribery” or “bribe” to describe president Trump’s conduct in the last six weeks of this inquiry is zero.",02:08,Vindman/Williams
1008,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"In fact, in these 3500 pages of sworn deposition testimony and just these 10 transcripts released thus far, the word “bribery” appears in these 3500 pages exactly one time, and ironically it appears not in a description of president Trump’s alleged conduct. It appears in the description of vice president Biden’s alleged conduct.",02:47,Vindman/Williams
1009,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"This is important because as early as next week, my democratic colleagues are going to say, “We need to vote on the evidence from this impeachment inquiry on the impeachment of the president for bribery.” And they’re going to send a report to the judiciary committee. And because there’s more Democrats than Republicans, it’s going to likely pass.",03:13,Vindman/Williams
1010,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"And when that happens, the American people need to be clear that when the Democrats, what they are describing as bribery, not a single witness is describing as bribery. We’ve heard many times in the course of this proceeding that the facts of the president are not in dispute, but the American people are asking if the facts are the same why do the crimes that the president is being accused of keep changing? Why do we go from quid pro quo to extortion, now to bribery? Chairman Nunez told you the answer. The answer is polling.",03:30,Vindman/Williams
1011,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"Washington Times asked Americans what would be the most damning accusation and it didn’t come back quid pro quo. It didn’t come back extortion, it came back bribery. So this case is all about bribery. Look, it’s bad enough that the Democrats have forbidden white house lawyers from participating in this proceeding. It’s hard enough to defend yourself without your lawyers present.",04:07,Vindman/Williams
1012,Section_17,John Ratcliffe,"But what’s even worse is trying to defend yourself against an accusation that keeps changing in the middle of the proceeding. If Democrats accused the president of a high crime or impeachable offense, he at least ought to know which one it is. And when speaker Pelosi says, “this is all about bribery,” she’s promised us evidence of bribery that would be compelling and overwhelming, and instead it’s invisible. I yield back.",04:28,Vindman/Williams
1013,Section_17,Mike Quigley,"Colonel, it’s one thing to ask somebody a favor like, “Hey, go pick up my dry cleaning.”, And it’s another, when the Commander in Chief of the most powerful army in the world ask an ally who’s in a vulnerable position to do him a favor, is it not?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1014,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,00:18,Vindman/Williams
1015,Section_18,Mike Quigley,Let me go back to that military assistance if I could.,00:21,Vindman/Williams
1016,Section_18,Mike Quigley,"Ms. Williams, again, when did you first learn that the security assistance was being held up, the nearly $400 million that was referenced?",00:24,Vindman/Williams
1017,Section_18,Jennifer Williams,July 3rd.,00:33,Vindman/Williams
1018,Section_18,Mike Quigley,And were you aware of any additional or did you attend any additional meetings in which that military assistance being withheld was discussed?,00:35,Vindman/Williams
1019,Section_18,Jennifer Williams,I did. I attended meetings on July 23rd and July 26th where the security assistance hold was discussed. I believe it may have also been discussed on July 31st.,00:45,Vindman/Williams
1020,Section_18,Mike Quigley,"At that point, did anyone provide a specific reason for the hold?",00:59,Vindman/Williams
1021,Section_18,Jennifer Williams,"In those meetings, the OMB representative reported that the assistance was being held at the direction of the White House Chief of Staff.",01:05,Vindman/Williams
1022,Section_18,Mike Quigley,And did they give reasons beyond that it was being withheld by the White House Chief of Staff?,01:13,Vindman/Williams
1023,Section_18,Jennifer Williams,Not specifically. The reason given was that there was an ongoing review whether the funding was still in line with administration priorities.,01:20,Vindman/Williams
1024,Section_18,Mike Quigley,"Did anyone in any of those meetings or in any other subsequent discussion you had, discuss the legality of withholding that aid?",01:30,Vindman/Williams
1025,Section_18,Jennifer Williams,"There were discussions, I believe, in the July 31st meeting and possibly prior as well, in terms of Defense and State Department officials were looking into how they would handle a situation in which ear-marked funding from Congress, that was designated for Ukraine, would be resolved if the funding continued to be held as we approached the end of the fiscal year.",01:40,Vindman/Williams
1026,Section_18,Mike Quigley,"And from what you witnessed, did anybody in the National Security Community support withholding the assistance?",02:05,Vindman/Williams
1027,Section_18,Jennifer Williams,No.,02:14,Vindman/Williams
1028,Section_18,Mike Quigley,"Colonel, again, just for the record, when did you first learn the security assistance was being withheld?",02:17,Vindman/Williams
1029,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,On or about July 3rd.,02:25,Vindman/Williams
1030,Section_18,Mike Quigley,"And what exactly had you learned from the state department, I believe, that prompted you to draft the notice on July 3rd?",02:28,Vindman/Williams
1031,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,"On or about July 3rd, I became aware of inquiries into security assistance funding in general. There are two typical pots, State Department and DOD, and I believe it was around that date that OMB put a hold on congressional notification.",02:38,Vindman/Williams
1032,Section_18,Mike Quigley,Had you had any earlier indications that this might be the case?,02:56,Vindman/Williams
1033,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,"Prior to that there were some general inquiries on how the funds were being spent, things of that nature. Nothing specific. No holds certainly.",03:01,Vindman/Williams
1034,Section_18,Mike Quigley,Were you aware of anyone in the National Security Community who supported withholding the aid?,03:10,Vindman/Williams
1035,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,No.,03:17,Vindman/Williams
1036,Section_18,Mike Quigley,No one from the National Security?,03:18,Vindman/Williams
1037,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,None.,03:21,Vindman/Williams
1038,Section_18,Mike Quigley,No one from the State Department?,03:21,Vindman/Williams
1039,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,03:23,Vindman/Williams
1040,Section_18,Mike Quigley,No one from the Department of Defense?,03:23,Vindman/Williams
1041,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,03:25,Vindman/Williams
1042,Section_18,Mike Quigley,"Did anyone, into your understanding, raise the legality of withholding this assistance?",03:26,Vindman/Williams
1043,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,It was raised on several occasions.,03:31,Vindman/Williams
1044,Section_18,Mike Quigley,And who raised those concerns?,03:34,Vindman/Williams
1045,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,"So following the July 18th Sub-PCC, which is, again, what I coordinate or what I convene at my level, there was a July 23rd PCC that would have been conducted by Mr. Morrison. There were questions raised as to the legality of the hold. Over the subsequent week, the issue was analyzed and during the July 26th… Deputies, the deputies from all the departments and agencies, there was opinion rendered that it was legal to put the hold.",03:36,Vindman/Williams
1046,Section_18,Mike Quigley,"It was, excuse me?",04:18,Vindman/Williams
1047,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,"There was an opinion, legal opinion, rendered that the hold was legal.",04:19,Vindman/Williams
1048,Section_18,Mike Quigley,On the purely legal point of view?,04:26,Vindman/Williams
1049,Section_18,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,04:28,Vindman/Williams
1050,Section_18,Mike Quigley,Very good. I yield back to the Chairman.,04:29,Vindman/Williams
1051,Section_18,Joaquin Castro,"Thank you Chairman, Ms. Williams, thank you for your service to the country. Colonel Vindman, thank you for your service and it’s great to talk to a fellow identical twin. I hope that your brother’s nicer to you than mine is to me. It doesn’t make you grow a beard.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1052,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,"You both listened in real time to the July 25th call. In particular, you would have heard president Trump asked the President of Ukraine quote, I’d like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike, end quote. The server, they say Ukraine has it. This is a debunk conspiracy theory that has no basis in fact. President Trump’s own former Homeland Security Advisor, Thomas P. Bossert, call the presence assertion that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 elections. Quote, not only a conspiracy theory, but quote unquote, completely debunked, unquote. Colonel Vindman, are you aware of any evidence to support the theory that the Ukrainian government interfered in the 2016 election?",00:18,Vindman/Williams
1053,Section_19,Alexander Vindman,"Congressman, I am not. And furthermore, I would say that this is a Russian narrative that President Putin has promoted.",01:03,Vindman/Williams
1054,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,"And are you aware of any part of the U.S. Government, its foreign policy or intelligence apparatus that supports that theory?",01:11,Vindman/Williams
1055,Section_19,Alexander Vindman,"No, I’m not aware of it.",01:19,Vindman/Williams
1056,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,"You are aware that other parts of the U.S. Government, our intelligence community, for example, has said definitively that it was the Russians who interfered in the 2016 elections?",01:22,Vindman/Williams
1057,Section_19,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,01:31,Vindman/Williams
1058,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,"It seems incredibly odd though, unfortunately, but not inconsistent to me that President Trump would be giving credence to a conspiracy theory about Ukraine that helps Russia really in at least two ways. First, it ignores and frankly undermines the assessment of the U.S. Intelligence community and seeks to weaken a state dependent on the United States support to fight Russian aggression. It also, for the United States, hurts our national security and emboldens Russia. And I want to look at what President Trump was doing on his call instead of pushing back against Russian hostility.",01:32,Vindman/Williams
1059,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,"He was pressuring Ukraine to do his political work. President Trump’s state on that July 25th call quote, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me. Colonel Vindman, when you hear those words, do you hear the President requesting a thoughtful and well calibrated anti-corruption program consistent with U.S. Policy?",02:12,Vindman/Williams
1060,Section_19,Alexander Vindman,I do not.,02:53,Vindman/Williams
1061,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,"In fact, it sounds like President Trump was encouraging the Ukrainian President to engage in precisely the same type of behavior for President Trump’s own political benefit that we discourage foreign leaders from undertaking in their own countries. And discouraging other countries from undertaking politically motivated investigation is in fact, a major part of official U.S. Anti corruption policy. Is that correct?",02:54,Vindman/Williams
1062,Section_19,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,03:22,Vindman/Williams
1063,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,And are you in fact aware of any evidence that Vice President Biden improperly interfered in investigation of his family members?,03:24,Vindman/Williams
1064,Section_19,Alexander Vindman,I am not.,03:34,Vindman/Williams
1065,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,"These false narratives, it should be said, are damaging our country. They poison our politics and distract from the truth and pressing another country to engage in corruption is antithetical to who we are as a nation. You also mentioned that this request where you felt this request was wrong. And you’ve also said that corruption in Ukraine is endemic to Ukraine just as it is in other places around the world.",03:36,Vindman/Williams
1066,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,"Can you speak to, what is the danger of a President of the United States, whether it’s Donald Trump or any future president asking another nation where there’s rampant corruption to investigate a political rival or just any other American citizen? What would be the danger to that American?",04:04,Vindman/Williams
1067,Section_19,Alexander Vindman,"Congressman, the Ukrainian judiciary is imperfect at the moment, and the reliance on U.S. support could conceivably causes them to tip the scales of justice in favor of finding the U.S. Edison guilty if they thought they needed to do that in our national security-",04:26,Vindman/Williams
1068,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,"So they could Trump up charges if they wanted to, in a corrupt system like that.",04:52,Vindman/Williams
1069,Section_19,Alexander Vindman,They could and Ukraine is making progress certainly more broadly in Russia. That is likely to happen where the state will be involved in judicial outcomes and drive them.,04:56,Vindman/Williams
1070,Section_19,Joaquin Castro,Thank you.,05:09,Vindman/Williams
1071,Section_19,Peter Welch,"Thank you. What this hearing is about, I think was best stated by Colonel Vindman’s opening statement. The question before us is this, is it improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a United States citizen and political opponent. Very well stated. I just listened to Mr. Jordan, as you did as well, and I heard his criticisms of the process. Nothing really happened. A lot of people are out to get the president. I didn’t hear an answer to the question as to whether it’s proper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent. And to date, I haven’t heard any one of my Republican colleagues address that question.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1072,Section_20,Peter Welch,"Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams, thank you. I want to ask some questions that go through the background. What’s come out during this process is that we had two Ukraine policies. One was bi-partisan and longstanding, and that was to assist Ukraine, which had freed itself from the domination of Russia, to fight corruption, and to resist Russian aggression. Is that a fair statement, Colonel Vindman.",01:04,Vindman/Williams
1073,Section_20,Alexander Vindman,"I think that’s a fair characterization, Congressman.",01:34,Vindman/Williams
1074,Section_20,Peter Welch,"And to give folks a reminder of the extent of corruption, by the way a legacy of Putin’s Russia. Is it your understanding that when their prior president, Mr. Yanukovych, fled to Russia into the arms of Mr. Putin, he took with him 30 to $40 billion of that impoverished country.",01:37,Vindman/Williams
1075,Section_20,Alexander Vindman,"There are different estimates, but it’s on that scale, yes.",02:04,Vindman/Williams
1076,Section_20,Peter Welch,Vast scale for a poor country. And is it your understanding that powerless but motivated Ukrainians rose up in protest to this incredible graft and theft and abuse by their president?,02:06,Vindman/Williams
1077,Section_20,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:25,Vindman/Williams
1078,Section_20,Peter Welch,"And that was in the Maidan, it was called the Maidan Revolution, the Revolution of Dignity, correct?",02:26,Vindman/Williams
1079,Section_20,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,02:32,Vindman/Williams
1080,Section_20,Peter Welch,"And young people went into that square in downtown Kiev and demonstrated for months, correct?",02:33,Vindman/Williams
1081,Section_20,Alexander Vindman,"Correct, and 100 died.",02:43,Vindman/Williams
1082,Section_20,Peter Welch,"106 young people died and older people died. Correct, that was in between February 18, 2014 and February 22, is that correct?",02:45,Vindman/Williams
1083,Section_20,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,02:59,Vindman/Williams
1084,Section_20,Peter Welch,"106 died including people who were shot by snipers, kids. Yanukovych had put snipers on the rooftops of buildings to shoot into that square and kill, murder, slaughter those young people. Is that your understanding?",03:00,Vindman/Williams
1085,Section_20,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,03:21,Vindman/Williams
1086,Section_20,Peter Welch,"In our bipartisan support, and by the way, I want to say to my Republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side. Thank you. But our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that Russian aggression. Is that correct?",03:23,Vindman/Williams
1087,Section_20,Alexander Vindman,That amounts to some of their key pillars.,03:42,Vindman/Williams
1088,Section_20,Peter Welch,"That’s right. And the Giuliani, Sondman, and it appears Trump policy was not about that. It was about investigations into a political opponent. Correct? I’ll take that question back. We know it.",03:45,Vindman/Williams
1089,Section_20,Peter Welch,"And you know, I’ll say this to President Trump. You want to investigate Joe Biden? You want to investigate Hunter Biden? Go at it. Do it. Do it hard. Do it dirty. Do it the way you do, do it. Just don’t do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. That’s your job, it’s not his.",04:04,Vindman/Williams
1090,Section_20,Peter Welch,"My goal in these hearings is two things. One is to get an answer to Colonel Vindman’s question. And the second coming out of this is for us as a Congress to return to the Ukraine policy that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy both support, it’s not investigations, it’s the restoration of democracy in Ukraine and the resistance of Russian aggression. I yield back.",04:31,Vindman/Williams
1091,Section_20,Andre Carson,"Thank you, Chairman Schiff. I yield to the Chairman.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1092,Section_21,Adam Schiff,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. I wanted to just make one point clear for folks that are watching the hearing today, bribery does involve a quid pro quo. Bribery involves the conditioning of an official act for something of value. An official act may be a White House meeting. An official act may be 400 million in military aid and something of value to a president might include investigations of their political rival.",00:03,Vindman/Williams
1093,Section_21,Adam Schiff,"The reason we don’t ask witnesses that are fact witnesses to make the judgment about whether a crime or bribery has been committed or whether more significantly the … what the founders had in mind when they itemize bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors is your fact witnesses. It will be our job to decide whether the impeachable act of bribery has occurred. That’s why we don’t ask you those questions. For one thing, you’re also not aware of all the other facts that had been adduced during the investigation. With that, I yield back to Mr. Carson.",00:32,Vindman/Williams
1094,Section_21,Andre Carson,"Thank you, Chairman. Thank you both for your service. Colonel Vindman, you were in a July 10th White House meeting in Ambassador Bolton’s office, isn’t that right sir?",01:07,Vindman/Williams
1095,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,I’m sorry. Could you say that again?,01:16,Vindman/Williams
1096,Section_21,Andre Carson,You were in a July 10th White House meeting with Ambassador Bolton.,01:17,Vindman/Williams
1097,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,01:21,Vindman/Williams
1098,Section_21,Andre Carson,"In that meeting, the Ukrainians ask about when they would get their oval office meeting and Ambassador Solomon replied that they need to “Speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure a meeting with the President.” Is that correct sir?",01:22,Vindman/Williams
1099,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,01:37,Vindman/Williams
1100,Section_21,Andre Carson,Colonel Vindman. Did you later learn why Ambassador Bolton cut the meeting short?,01:39,Vindman/Williams
1101,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,I did.,01:44,Vindman/Williams
1102,Section_21,Andre Carson,"After Ambassador Bolton ended that meeting, sir, some of the group that attended a follow on meeting in a different room in the White House called the Ward Room, is that correct, sir?",01:46,Vindman/Williams
1103,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,01:55,Vindman/Williams
1104,Section_21,Andre Carson,"And Ambassador Solomon was there with the senior Ukrainian officials, is that correct?",01:56,Vindman/Williams
1105,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:00,Vindman/Williams
1106,Section_21,Andre Carson,"Did NSC lawyers tell you to come directly to them, sir, if you had any other concerns after July 10th?",02:04,Vindman/Williams
1107,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,"They said that … I believe the words were something to the effect of if you have any other concerns, feel free to come back.",02:12,Vindman/Williams
1108,Section_21,Andre Carson,"And this follow on meeting, sir, Ambassador Solomon left. In your words, “No ambiguity,” about what specific investigations he was requesting. Ambassador Solomon made clear that he was requesting an investigation of Vice President, Joe Biden’s son. Isn’t that correct, sir?",02:20,Vindman/Williams
1109,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:36,Vindman/Williams
1110,Section_21,Andre Carson,"And you stated that he was asking these requests in coordination with the chief of staff, White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney? Correct, sir?",02:37,Vindman/Williams
1111,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,That is what I heard him say.,02:44,Vindman/Williams
1112,Section_21,Andre Carson,"Colonel, in your career, had you ever before witnessed an American official requests that a foreign government investigate a US citizen who is related to the President’s political opponent?",02:45,Vindman/Williams
1113,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,I have not.,02:57,Vindman/Williams
1114,Section_21,Andre Carson,"And Colonel, you immediately raised concerns about this, correct, sir?",02:59,Vindman/Williams
1115,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,03:04,Vindman/Williams
1116,Section_21,Andre Carson,What exactly happened?,03:06,Vindman/Williams
1117,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,"After I reported it to the … I’m sorry. Oh, I’m sorry. Could you say that again? I apologize.",03:08,Vindman/Williams
1118,Section_21,Andre Carson,"You raised concerns about this, correct sir?",03:16,Vindman/Williams
1119,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,03:18,Vindman/Williams
1120,Section_21,Andre Carson,What happened?,03:18,Vindman/Williams
1121,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,"To Ambassador Solomon, if I understood you correctly, I stated that it was inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security policy.",03:20,Vindman/Williams
1122,Section_21,Andre Carson,Did you also raise concern that day with White House lawyers?,03:28,Vindman/Williams
1123,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,I did.,03:32,Vindman/Williams
1124,Section_21,Andre Carson,What did you tell them?,03:34,Vindman/Williams
1125,Section_21,Alexander Vindman,"I reported the same thing that … I reported the content of the conversation with Ambassador Solomon. At that point, I wasn’t aware that Dr. Hill had a conversation with Ambassador Bolton. And so I just relayed what I experienced to the attorney, lead legal counsel.",03:35,Vindman/Williams
1126,Section_21,Andre Carson,"As we are now aware sir, Ambassador Bolton expressed his concerns and instructed Dr. Fiona Hill, your supervisor, to also meet with the same White House lawyers to tell them what happened. Colonel Vindman, I agree that there is no question that Ambassador Solomon was proposing a transaction to Ukrainian officials trading White House meetings for specific investigations with the full awareness of the President’s chief of staff, White House attorneys, and his national security advisor. In my view, sir, that’s appalling. Thank you both for your service. I yield back to the chairman.",03:54,Vindman/Williams
1127,Section_21,Jackie Speier,"Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you both for your testimony and your service. Colonel Vindman, wasn’t it the case that Mr. Eisenberg, the attorney, had said to you after the July 5th meeting that you should come to him if you have any other concerns?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1128,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,"After the July 10th meeting, yes ma’am, that is correct.",00:18,Vindman/Williams
1129,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"And it is not going outside the chain of command to speak to the lawyer within the institution, is that correct?",00:20,Vindman/Williams
1130,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,"No, he is the senior between the two, certainly.",00:26,Vindman/Williams
1131,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"All right. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been complaining about other witnesses having only secondhand information, but in both your cases you have firsthand information because you were on the July 25th phone call, is that correct?",00:31,Vindman/Williams
1132,Section_22,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,00:46,Vindman/Williams
1133,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,00:47,Vindman/Williams
1134,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"Now, Colonel, you in your comments today said, “I want to state that the vile character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible.” Would you like to expand on that at all?",00:48,Vindman/Williams
1135,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,"Ma’am, I think they stand on their own. I don’t think it’s necessarily to expand on it.",01:06,Vindman/Williams
1136,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"So in both your situations, since you have given depositions, since those depositions have been made public, have you seen your experience in your respective jobs change or have you been treated any differently?",01:11,Vindman/Williams
1137,Section_22,Jennifer Williams,"I have not, no.",01:28,Vindman/Williams
1138,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,"Since the report on July 25th as I stated, I did notice I was being excluded from several meetings that would have been appropriate for my position.",01:31,Vindman/Williams
1139,Section_22,Jackie Speier,So in some respects then there have been reprisals?,01:46,Vindman/Williams
1140,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,I’m not sure if I could make that judgment. I could say that it would was out of the course of normal affairs to not have me participate in some of these events.,01:51,Vindman/Williams
1141,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"Thank you. In preparation for the July 25th phone call, it’s standard for the National Security Council to provide talking points. Is that correct?",02:00,Vindman/Williams
1142,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,02:09,Vindman/Williams
1143,Section_22,Jackie Speier,Because the words of the President carry incredible weight. Is that not correct?,02:11,Vindman/Williams
1144,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:17,Vindman/Williams
1145,Section_22,Jackie Speier,So it’s important to ensure that everyone has carefully considered the implications of what the President might say to a foreign leader.,02:18,Vindman/Williams
1146,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:27,Vindman/Williams
1147,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"Colonel Vindman, you are the National Security Council’s director for Ukraine, did you participate in preparing the talking points for the president’s call?",02:28,Vindman/Williams
1148,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,"I did, I prepared them.",02:37,Vindman/Williams
1149,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"So you prepared them, they were then reviewed and edited by multiple senior officers at the NSC and the White House. Is that correct?",02:40,Vindman/Williams
1150,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:48,Vindman/Williams
1151,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"Did the talking points for the President contained any discussion of investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens or Burisma?",02:50,Vindman/Williams
1152,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,They did not.,02:59,Vindman/Williams
1153,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"Are you aware of any written product from the National Security Council suggesting that investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens or Burisma are part of the official policy of the United States?",03:00,Vindman/Williams
1154,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,"No, I’m not.",03:14,Vindman/Williams
1155,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"Some of President Trump’s allies have suggested that the President requested these investigations for official policy reasons, as part of some plan to root out corruption in Ukraine. In your experience, did the official policies of the United States include asking Ukraine to specifically open investigations into the Bidens and interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election?",03:16,Vindman/Williams
1156,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,Nothing that we prepared or had discussed up until that point included any of these elements.,03:41,Vindman/Williams
1157,Section_22,Jackie Speier,Would it ever be U.S. policy in your experience to ask a foreign leader to open a political investigation?,03:46,Vindman/Williams
1158,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,"There are proper procedures in which to do that. Certainly the President is well within his right to do that. It is not something the NSC, certainly a director at the NSC would do. As a matter of fact, we are prohibited from being involved in any transaction between Department of Justice and a foreign power to ensure that there is no perception of manipulation from the White House. So it is not something that we’d participate in.",03:54,Vindman/Williams
1159,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"Ms. Williams, in your experience, did the official policies of the United States include asking Ukraine to open investigations into the Bidens?",04:22,Vindman/Williams
1160,Section_22,Alexander Vindman,I had not seen any reference to those particular cases in our policy formulation process.,04:30,Vindman/Williams
1161,Section_22,Jackie Speier,"All right. Let me just say to you, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman that in listening to your opening statement, I had chills up and down my spine and I think most Americans recognize what an extraordinary hero you are to our country. And I would say to your father, he did well. I yield back.",04:35,Vindman/Williams
1162,Section_22,Eric Swalwell,Thank you both Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. I think the followup question that my colleague from New York did not ask you but is relevant for everyone at home. Isn’t it true that the department of defense had certified that the anti-corruption requirements of Ukraine had been met when the hold was put on by the president?,00:00,Vindman/Williams
1163,Section_23,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,00:19,Vindman/Williams
1164,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"Now, Mr. Jordan suggested that the president did something, none of us expected by releasing that call transcript. You listened to the call, is that right Lieutenant Colonel?",00:20,Vindman/Williams
1165,Section_23,Alexander Vindman,That is.,00:31,Vindman/Williams
1166,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,Ms. Williams. You also listen to the calls is that right?,00:32,Vindman/Williams
1167,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,Yes.,00:34,Vindman/Williams
1168,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,Fair to say Ms. Williams. A lot of other people at the White House listen to the call or read the transcript.,00:35,Vindman/Williams
1169,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,"I can’t characterize how many, I believe there were four, five or six of us in the listening room at the time.",00:41,Vindman/Williams
1170,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,And the transcript was distributed to others. Is that right?,00:48,Vindman/Williams
1171,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,"I wasn’t part of that process, but that’s my understanding.",00:52,Vindman/Williams
1172,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"So the president is asking for us and his defenders to give him a gold star because a number of people listen to the call or saw the call transcript and then he released it. The difference of course between this and say his one on one meeting in Helsinki with Vladimir Putin was there. It was a one on one meeting and he took the notes from the interpreter so none of us could see it. The point being the president had no choice but to release a call that everyone had seen. Now you’ve been asked to also characterize what exactly legally all of this means and Mr. Ratcliffe pointed out that no one had used the term bribery in our depositions and Ms. Williams, you’re not a lawyer, are you?",00:54,Vindman/Williams
1173,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,I’m not. No.,01:34,Vindman/Williams
1174,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,Lieutenant Colonel Vindman? Are you a lawyer?,01:35,Vindman/Williams
1175,Section_23,Alexander Vindman,Lawyers back there?,01:38,Vindman/Williams
1176,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"The lawyers, your brother, right? Born 20 seconds after you, is that what you said?",01:38,Vindman/Williams
1177,Section_23,Alexander Vindman,Nine minutes.,01:42,Vindman/Williams
1178,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"Nine minutes after you, you’re the older brother.",01:43,Vindman/Williams
1179,Section_23,Alexander Vindman,"Yeah, lifetime wisdom there.",01:45,Vindman/Williams
1180,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"Now I want to give you a hypothetical here. Suppose you have a shooting victim and the police respond after the victim is doing a little bit better and they ask the victim will tell us what happened. And the victim says, “Well someone came up to my car, shot into the car, hit me in the shoulder, hit me in the back, hit me in the neck. Miraculously I survived, but I can identify who the person is that pulled the trigger.” The police say, “Okay, you were shot, you know who it is but shucks. You didn’t tell us that this was an attempted murder, so we’re going to have to let the person go.”",01:47,Vindman/Williams
1181,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"Is that how it works in our justice system that unless victims or witnesses identify the legal theories of a case, we just let people off the hook. Is that how it works Lieutenant Colonel Vindman?",02:26,Vindman/Williams
1182,Section_23,Alexander Vindman,I’m not an attorney but it doesn’t seem so.,02:37,Vindman/Williams
1183,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"I don’t think your brother would think so either. Ms. Williams, Vice President Pence was described to our committee by Mr. Morrison as a quote, “Voracious reader of his intelligence read book.” And after the April 21 call with President Zelensky, you put a transcript of that call in the vice president’s read book, is that right?",02:39,Vindman/Williams
1184,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,02:57,Vindman/Williams
1185,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"And then the vice president called President Zelensky two days later, is that right?",02:57,Vindman/Williams
1186,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,03:02,Vindman/Williams
1187,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"And you told us in the deposition that he stuck pretty faithfully to what President Trump had said in that April 21 call, is that right?",03:02,Vindman/Williams
1188,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,"I believe his remarks were consistent, but he also spoke on other issues as well, including anti-corruption.",03:10,Vindman/Williams
1189,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,And you would describe the vice president is somebody who would make followup calls to world leaders after the president had done so. Is that right?,03:16,Vindman/Williams
1190,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,He has on occasion. It’s not a normal practice. It depends on the situation.,03:25,Vindman/Williams
1191,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"And in that case, he stuck to President Trump’s talking points.",03:29,Vindman/Williams
1192,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,"I would say that I provided talking points for the April 23 call for the vice president, which included discussion of President’s Zelensky’s inauguration, which President Trump had also discussed with President Zelensky. But I would say the vice president discussed other issues with President Zelensky as well.",03:34,Vindman/Williams
1193,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"And as was stated earlier, the president sets the foreign policy for the United States. Is that right?",03:50,Vindman/Williams
1194,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,Absolutely.,03:55,Vindman/Williams
1195,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,And you told us that after the July 25 call between President Trump and President Zelensky that you put the call transcript in Vice President Pence’s intelligence briefing book. Is that right?,03:56,Vindman/Williams
1196,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,"I insured, it was there. My colleagues prepare the book, but yes.",04:06,Vindman/Williams
1197,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,So let’s flash forward to September one Vice President Pence meets with President Zelensky. Is that right?,04:09,Vindman/Williams
1198,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct.,04:15,Vindman/Williams
1199,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,You’re there?,04:16,Vindman/Williams
1200,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,Yes.,04:17,Vindman/Williams
1201,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"And President Zelensky with Vice President Pence. They talk about a lot of things, but you will agree that Vice President Pence did not bring up the Bidens. Is that correct?",04:17,Vindman/Williams
1202,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,That’s correct. He did not.,04:26,Vindman/Williams
1203,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,He did not bring up investigations.,04:27,Vindman/Williams
1204,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,No.,04:28,Vindman/Williams
1205,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"Is one reasonable explanation that although Vice President Pence will do a lot of things for President Trump, that he was not willing to bring up investigations in Biden’s because he thought it was wrong.",04:29,Vindman/Williams
1206,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,I’m not in a position to speculate. We had not discussed those particular investigations in any of their preparatory sessions with the vice president. I’m not-,04:43,Vindman/Williams
1207,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"But you didn’t bring it up with the Ukrainians after the July 25 call, right?",04:50,Vindman/Williams
1208,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,"He did not in that meeting, no.",04:54,Vindman/Williams
1209,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,And you did not either?,04:55,Vindman/Williams
1210,Section_23,Jennifer Williams,No.,04:56,Vindman/Williams
1211,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,"And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, did you ever ask the Ukrainians to do what President Trump was asking them to do after the July 25 phone call?",04:57,Vindman/Williams
1212,Section_23,Alexander Vindman,I did not. I didn’t render any opinion on what was asked in the 25.,05:04,Vindman/Williams
1213,Section_23,Eric Swalwell,Thank you. Yield then.,05:09,Vindman/Williams
1214,Section_23,Jim Jordan,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sunday, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives called the President of the United States and impostor. Speaker of the House called the President an imposter. The guy 63 million people voted for, the guy who won an electoral college landslide, the speaker calls an impostor. That’s what’s happened to our country, to this Congress. The speaker’s statement says it all, the Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people, Democrats don’t trust the American people. The American people who wanted to send someone to this town who was willing to shake it up a bit, they don’t trust that and they have tried to do everything they can to undo what the American people decided on November 8th, 2016.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1215,Section_24,Jim Jordan,"They’ve been out to get the President since the day he was elected. The whistle blowers lawyer, the whistle blowers legal team said this January 30th, 2017, President had been in office about a week, “Coup has started, first of many steps.” Next sentence, “Impeachment will follow ultimately.” I guess we’re in the final step started three and a half years ago. Congressman Tlaib started this Congress, first day of Congress said, “Impeach the President.” Representative Green said, “If we don’t impeach him, the President’s going to win reelection. We got to do it.” Most importantly, five Democrat members of this committee voted to move forward with impeachment before the phone call ever happened.",00:58,Vindman/Williams
1216,Section_24,Jim Jordan,"The truth is the attacks actually started before the inauguration, even before the election. A ranking member talked about this. His opening statement July 2016, “FBI opens an investigation so-called Trump, Russia Coordination Collusion,” which was never there. Opened an investigation, spied on two American citizens associated with the Presidential campaign. My guess is that’s probably never happened in American history, but they did it. And for 10 months, Jim Comey’s FBI investigated the President. Guess what? After 10 months they had nothing and you know why we know that? Because when we deposed Mr. Comey last Congress, he told us they didn’t have a thing. No matter, Special Counsel Mueller gets appointed and they do a two year, $40 million, 19 lawyer unbelievable investigation and guess what? They come back and they got nothing, but the Democrats don’t care.",01:52,Vindman/Williams
1217,Section_24,Jim Jordan,"So now we get this, a bunch of depositions in the bunker, in the basement of the Capitol, witnesses who aren’t allowed to answer questions about who they talked to about the phone call. We get this all based on some anonymous whistleblower, no firsthand knowledge, bias against the president. These facts have never changed, we learned these right away. Who worked with Vice President Biden, who wrote a memo the day after somebody talked to him about the call, but waited 18 days to file a complaint. 18 days to file a complaint, what did he do in those 18 days? We all know, ran off and talk with Chairman Schiff’s staff and then hired the legal team that I just talked about. One of those steps in the whole impeachment coup as his legal team has said.",02:53,Vindman/Williams
1218,Section_24,Jim Jordan,"This is scary what these guys are putting our country through. It is sad, it is scary, it is wrong. And the good news is the American people see through it all. They know the facts are on the President’s side as Representative Stefanik said, “Four facts will never change.” We got the transcript, which they never thought the President would release, shows no coordination, no conditionality, no linkage. We got the two guys on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky, who have said nothing wrong, no pressure, no pushing here. We got the fact that Ukrainians didn’t even know aid was held up at the time of the call, and most importantly, we have yet to have one witness tell us that any evidence from anyone that that President Zelensky did anything on investigations to get the aid released.",03:49,Vindman/Williams
1219,Section_24,Jim Jordan,"Those facts will never change. The facts are on the President’s side, the process is certainly not. It has been the most unfair process we have ever seen and the American people understand that those 63 million Americans, they understand it. And frankly, I think a lot of others do as well. They see this for what it is and they know this is wrong. Especially wrong just 11 months before the next election. I yield back.",04:34,Vindman/Williams
1220,Section_24,Devin Nunes,"Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, before I turn to Mr. Jordan, I asked Ms. Williams about this, about, if she had ever accessed, without authorization, a fellow employee’s computer system. She answered no to the question. Have you ever accessed anyone’s computer system at the NSC without authorization?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1221,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,Without their knowledge? No.,00:26,Vindman/Williams
1222,Section_25,Devin Nunes,Knowledge or authorization?,00:30,Vindman/Williams
1223,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,I’m sorry?,00:32,Vindman/Williams
1224,Section_25,Devin Nunes,"Knowledge or authorization, you never accessed someone’s computer without their knowledge or authorization?",00:33,Vindman/Williams
1225,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,00:39,Vindman/Williams
1226,Section_25,Devin Nunes,Mr. Jordan.,00:41,Vindman/Williams
1227,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"I thank the ranking member. Colonel, I want to thank you for your service and sacrifice to our great country. This afternoon, your former boss, Mr. Morrison, is going to be sitting right where you’re sitting and he’s going to testify. And I want to give you a chance, I think we’re bringing you a copy, I want to give you a chance to respond to some of the things Mr. Morrison said in his deposition, page 82 of the transcript from Mr. Morrison.",00:42,Vindman/Williams
1228,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"Mr. Morrison said this: “I had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s judgment. Among the discussions I had with Dr. Hill in the transition with our team, its strength, its weaknesses, and Fiona and others had raised concerns about Alex’s judgment.” When Mr. Morrison was asked by Mr. Castor, “Did anyone ever bring concerns to you that they believe Colonel Vindman may have leaked something,” Mr. Morrison replied, “Yes.”",01:07,Vindman/Williams
1229,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"So your boss had concerns about your judgment. Your former boss, Dr. Hill, had concerns about your judgment. Your colleagues had concerns about your judgment. And your colleagues felt that there were times when you leaked information. Any idea why they have those impressions, Colonel Vindman?",01:33,Vindman/Williams
1230,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, Representative Jordan, I guess I’ll start by reading Dr. Hill’s own words, as she attested to in my last evaluation that was dated middle of July, right before she left. “Alex is a top 1% military officer and the best army officer I’ve worked with in my 15 years of government service. He is brilliant, unflappable, and exercises excellent judgment.”",01:49,Vindman/Williams
1231,Section_25,Jim Jordan,So it was-,02:14,Vindman/Williams
1232,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,I’m sorry.,02:15,Vindman/Williams
1233,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"Okay, I’m sorry.",02:16,Vindman/Williams
1234,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,"“He was exemplary during numerous visits,” so forth and so on. But I think you get the idea. Mr. Morrison, yeah, the date of that was, yeah, let’s see, I’m sorry, July 13th. So Mr. Jordan, I would say that I can’t say why Mr. Morrison questioned my judgment. We had only recently started working together. He wasn’t there very long, and we were just trying to figure out our relationship. Maybe it was a different culture, it was a military culture versus-",02:16,Vindman/Williams
1235,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"And Colonel, you never leaked information?",02:53,Vindman/Williams
1236,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,"I never did, never would. That is preposterous that I would do that.",02:55,Vindman/Williams
1237,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"Okay. Colonel, it’s interesting, we deposed a lot of people in the bunker, in the basement of the Capitol, over the last several weeks, but of all those depositions, only three of the individuals we deposed were actually on the now-somewhat-famous July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. There was you, the individual sitting beside you, Ms. Williams, and then there, of course, was your boss, Mr. Morrison, who I just read from his deposition.",03:00,Vindman/Williams
1238,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"When we asked Ms. Williams who she spoke to after the call, about the call, she was willing to answer our questions and Chairman Schiff allowed her to answer our questions. When we asked Mr. Morrison who he spoke to after the call, about the call, he was willing to answer our question and Chairman Schiff allowed him to answer our question. But when we asked you, you first told us three individuals at the NSC, your brother and the two lawyers. And then you said there was a group of other people you communicated with, but you would only give us one individual in that group, Secretary Kent. And the Chairman would only allow you to give us that name. When we asked you who else you communicated with, you would not tell us. So I want to know first, how many other people are in that group of people you communicated with outside the four individuals I just named?",03:24,Vindman/Williams
1239,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,"Mr. Jordan, on call readout, certainly after the first call, there were probably a half a dozen or more people that I read out. Those are people with the proper clearance and the need to know. In this case, because of the sensitivity of the call, and Mr. Eisenberg told me not to speak to anybody else, I only read out, outside of the NSC, two individuals.",04:11,Vindman/Williams
1240,Section_25,Jim Jordan,Two individuals.,04:32,Vindman/Williams
1241,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,DAS Kent and one other person.,04:33,Vindman/Williams
1242,Section_25,Alexander Vindman,And you’re not willing to tell us who that other individual is?,04:35,Vindman/Williams

1251,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"Mr. Chairman, I don’t see how this is outing the whistleblower. The witness has testified in his deposition that he doesn’t know who the whistleblower is. You have said, even though no one believes you, you have said you don’t know who the whistleblower is. So how is this outing the whistleblower to find out who this individual is?",05:07,Vindman/Williams
1252,Section_25,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Jordan, this is your time for questioning. You can use it any way you like, but your question should be addressed to the witness.",05:23,Vindman/Williams
1253,Section_25,Jim Jordan,And I’d like to-,05:30,Vindman/Williams
1254,Section_25,Adam Schiff,And your question should not be addressed to trying to out the whistleblower.,05:31,Vindman/Williams
1255,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"Well, okay. Colonel Vindman, there’s another thing Mr. Morrison told us in his deposition, he said he was not concerned about the call itself. He said there was nothing illegal or improper on the call. But he was concerned about the call leaking, the contents of the call leaking. He said this, he was concerned how it would play out in Washington’s polarized environment, how the contents would be used in Washington’s political process.",05:33,Vindman/Williams
1256,Section_25,Speaker 5,Excuse me-,06:00,Vindman/Williams

1260,Section_25,Speaker 5,Thank you.,06:06,Vindman/Williams
1261,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"Mr. Morrison was right. The call leaks, the whistleblower goes to Chairman Schiff’s staff, then he runs off to the lawyer, the same lawyer who said in January of 2017, “The coup has started against President Trump.” The one thing the Democrats didn’t, the one thing they didn’t count on, one thing they didn’t count on was the president releasing the call transcript and letting us all see what he said. They didn’t count on that. The transcript shows no linkage. The two individuals on the call have both said no pressure, no pushing, no linkage, [inaudible 00:06:41] security assistance dollars to an investigation.",06:07,Vindman/Williams
1262,Section_25,Jim Jordan,"Ms. Williams, after the call on the 25th, we know that Colonel Vindman talked to several people, after the call on the 25th, how many people did you talk to about the call?",06:46,Vindman/Williams

1290,Section_26,Rep. Heck,But you could have been subjected to additional harm. You chose to continue service in uniform.,03:23,Vindman/Williams
1291,Section_26,Alexander Vindman,I continued to serve in combat for the remaining 10 or 11 months of the tour.,03:28,Vindman/Williams
1292,Section_26,Rep. Heck,"You know, Colonel, I have to say I find it a rich but incredibly painful irony that within a week of the President, contrary to all advice of the senior military officials, he pardons those who are convicted of war crimes, which was widely decried in the military community. Within the week of him doing that he’s engaged in an effort and allies on his behalf, including some here today, to demean your record of service, and the sacrifice, and the contribution you have made. Indeed, sir, less than 20 minutes ago, the White House officially quoted out, out of context, the comments referred to earlier by Mr. Morrison in your judgment.",03:33,Vindman/Williams
1293,Section_26,Rep. Heck,"I can only conclude, sir, that what we thought was just the President as the subject of our deliberations in this inquiry isn’t sufficient to capture what’s happening here. Indeed, what’s subject to this inquiry and what is at peril is our constitution and the very values upon which it is based. I want to say thank you for your service, but thank you doesn’t cut it. Please know, however, that it comes from the bottom of my heart and I know from the bottoms of the heart of countless other Americans. Thank you for your service, sir. I yield back.",04:27,Vindman/Williams
1294,Section_26,Will Hurd,"Miss Williams, I want to join my colleagues in thanking you for your service. We share a personal hero in Dr. Rice. So great minds think alike.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1295,Section_27,Will Hurd,Did you participate in or overhear any conversations about how potential information collected from the Ukrainians on the Bidens would be used for political gain?,00:09,Vindman/Williams
1296,Section_27,Jennifer Williams,No. I did not participate or overhear any conversations along those lines.,00:21,Vindman/Williams
1297,Section_27,Will Hurd,"Thank you. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I think all of us would agree that your father made the right move to come here and we’re glad that he did. You’ve talked about how part of your responsibilities is developing talking points for your principles. Is that correct?",00:25,Vindman/Williams
1298,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,00:40,Vindman/Williams
1299,Section_27,Will Hurd,"President. I’m assuming you also do that for your direct supervisor, currently right now, Mr. Morrison. Is that correct?",00:41,Vindman/Williams
1300,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,Mr. Morrison has left the position some time ago already. At least three weeks ago.,00:48,Vindman/Williams
1301,Section_27,Will Hurd,But you prepare talking points for your supervisors. Is that correct?,00:53,Vindman/Williams
1302,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,"Typically, I frankly, at that level, they don’t really take talking points, especially if they have expertise. The talking points are more intended for national security advisor, although Ambassador Bolton didn’t really require it because of his deep expertise. It’s the next level up. The President-",00:58,Vindman/Williams
1303,Section_27,Will Hurd,"But traditionally, I’m just trying to establish-",01:14,Vindman/Williams
1304,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,I know.,01:16,Vindman/Williams
1305,Section_27,Will Hurd,That this position is somebody that creates talking points for a number of people. Is that correct?,01:16,Vindman/Williams
1306,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,01:20,Vindman/Williams
1307,Section_27,Will Hurd,Do they always use them?,01:21,Vindman/Williams
1308,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,No.,01:22,Vindman/Williams
1309,Section_27,Will Hurd,Is President Trump known to stick to a script?,01:25,Vindman/Williams
1310,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,I don’t believe so.,01:31,Vindman/Williams
1311,Section_27,Will Hurd,So is it odd that he didn’t use your talking points?,01:33,Vindman/Williams
1312,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,"No, it is not.",01:36,Vindman/Williams
1313,Section_27,Will Hurd,"In your deposition … If your lawyer wants to follow on, it’s page 306 … You were asked about events during the temporary hold on US assistance to Ukraine. This is that 55 day period or so. And you testified that the US administration did no receive any new assurances from Ukraine about anti-corruption efforts and the facts on the ground did not change before the hold was lifted. Is that accurate in recounting your testimony?",01:37,Vindman/Williams
1314,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,That is accurate.,02:05,Vindman/Williams
1315,Section_27,Will Hurd,When was President Zelensky sworn in?,02:06,Vindman/Williams
1316,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,"He was sworn in on May 20, 2019.",02:09,Vindman/Williams
1317,Section_27,Will Hurd,"And then he had a new Parliament too, elected after he was. Is that correct?",02:14,Vindman/Williams
1318,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,He did.,02:18,Vindman/Williams
1319,Section_27,Will Hurd,And when was that Parliament seated?,02:19,Vindman/Williams
1320,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,"That was July 21, 2019.",02:21,Vindman/Williams
1321,Section_27,Will Hurd,"That was when they won, right? They weren’t properly seated until August? Is that-",02:28,Vindman/Williams
1322,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,That’s right. That’s when they won and they weren’t seated until August.,02:31,Vindman/Williams
1323,Section_27,Will Hurd,"Your boss’s boss, Ambassador Bolton, traveled to Ukraine in late August, right? August 27, 28. Is that correct?",02:34,Vindman/Williams
1324,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:41,Vindman/Williams
1325,Section_27,Will Hurd,Did he take you with him?,02:43,Vindman/Williams
1326,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,He didn’t.,02:45,Vindman/Williams
1327,Section_27,Will Hurd,"We know form other witnesses that when Ambassador Bolton was there, he met with President Zelensky and his staff and they talked about how they were visually exhausted because one of the things that President Zelensky did during that time period was change the Ukrainian constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada deputies. Right? Some of their parliamentarians. Because that had been the source of raw corruption for a number of years. Is that accurate?",02:47,Vindman/Williams
1328,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,That is accurate.,03:13,Vindman/Williams
1329,Section_27,Will Hurd,Were you aware of this important change to Ukrainian law?,03:14,Vindman/Williams
1330,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,Of course. Yup.,03:17,Vindman/Williams
1331,Section_27,Will Hurd,And you don’t believe that’s a significant anti-corruption effort?,03:18,Vindman/Williams
1332,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,"No, it is. It is significant.",03:21,Vindman/Williams
1333,Section_27,Will Hurd,"It’s pretty significant, correct? Also, Ambassador Taylor testified that President Zelensky, with this new Parliament, opened Ukraine’s high anti-corruption court. Right? This had been an initiative that many folks in our State Department had been pushing to happen. And that was established in that time frame. Were you aware of this?",03:22,Vindman/Williams
1334,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,03:46,Vindman/Williams
1335,Section_27,Will Hurd,Do you think this is a significant anti-corruption?,03:47,Vindman/Williams
1336,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,I do.,03:49,Vindman/Williams
1337,Section_27,Will Hurd,When you talked about … How many times have you met President Zelensky?,03:53,Vindman/Williams
1338,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,"I think it was just the one time from the Presidential Delegation. Multiple engagements, but just the one trip.",04:00,Vindman/Williams
1339,Section_27,Will Hurd,And that’s a one on one meeting?,04:06,Vindman/Williams
1340,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,"That was in a larger, bilateral format. Then there were a couple of smaller venue … There was never a one on one, but there were a couple of, again, touchpoints. So the bilateral meeting, handshake, meet and greet. He had a short-",04:08,Vindman/Williams
1341,Section_27,Will Hurd,So there was a lot of people in the room-,04:26,Vindman/Williams
1342,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,Yeah.,04:28,Vindman/Williams
1343,Section_27,Will Hurd,When you met with him.,04:29,Vindman/Williams
1344,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,04:30,Vindman/Williams

1346,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,04:35,Vindman/Williams
1347,Section_27,Will Hurd,"And everybody else in the room I’m assuming, the national security advisory was there, I believe. In this case, you had other members of the administration. Were your points pre approved? Did they know you were going to bring up those points?",04:35,Vindman/Williams
1348,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,"We did have a huddle beforehand and it’s possible I flagged them, but I don’t recall specifically. It’s possible I didn’t.",04:52,Vindman/Williams
1349,Section_27,Will Hurd,And you counseled the Ukrainian president to stay out of US politics?,05:00,Vindman/Williams
1350,Section_27,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,05:05,Vindman/Williams
1351,Section_27,Will Hurd,"Mr. Chairman, I yield back the time I do not have.",05:07,Vindman/Williams
1352,Section_27,Elise Stefanik,"Ms. Williams, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, thank you for being here and thank you both for your service. As millions of Americans are watching throughout the hysteria and frenzied media coverage, two key facts have not changed that are critical to these impeachment proceedings. One, Ukraine in fact received the aid and two, there was no investigation into the Biden’s. My question to both of you today will focus on the following, systemic corruption in Ukraine. Two, highlighting for the public that by-law aid to Ukraine requires anti-corruption efforts.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1353,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"And three, who in our government has the decision making authority when it comes to foreign policy and national security matters? So on corruption in Ukraine, as ambassador Yovanovitch testified, one of the key reasons why president Zelensky was overwhelmingly elected by the Ukrainian people, was that they were finally standing up to ramp and corruption in their country. Would you both agree with the ambassador’s assessment?",00:31,Vindman/Williams
1354,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,Yes.,00:53,Vindman/Williams
1355,Section_28,Jennifer Williams,Yes.,00:54,Vindman/Williams
1356,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"And Ms. Williams, corruption was such a critical issue from your perspective that when you prepared the vice president for his congratulatory call with presidents Zelensky, you testified that the points you wanted to communicate on the call where the following, quote, “Looked forward to seeing president Zelensky really implement the agenda on which he had run related to anti-corruption reforms.” That’s correct?",00:54,Vindman/Williams
1357,Section_28,Jennifer Williams,"That is, yes.",01:16,Vindman/Williams
1358,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, would you agree that this focus on anti-corruption is a critical aspect of our policy towards Ukraine?",01:16,Vindman/Williams
1359,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,I would.,01:23,Vindman/Williams
1360,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you are aware that in 2014 during the Obama administration, the first anti-corruption investigation, partner between the U.S. The U.K. And Ukraine was into the owner of the company Burisma?",01:24,Vindman/Williams
1361,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,I’m aware of it now.,01:37,Vindman/Williams
1362,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you testified that you were aware that Burisma had questionable business dealings, that’s part of its track record?",01:39,Vindman/Williams
1363,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,01:46,Vindman/Williams
1364,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"You also testified that regarding Burisma, money laundering, tax evasion comports with your understanding of how business is done in Ukraine. Is that correct?",01:47,Vindman/Williams
1365,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,"I’m not aware of specific incidents, but my understanding is that it would not be out of the realm of the possible for Burisma.",01:56,Vindman/Williams
1366,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"Well, that’s page 207 from your testimony, but I’ll move on. You are aware that Hunter Biden did sit on the board of the Burisma at this time?",02:03,Vindman/Williams
1367,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,I am.,02:10,Vindman/Williams
1368,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"Well, I know that my constituents in New York 21 have many concerns about the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of the vice president, sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burisma. The Obama administration state department was also concerned and yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call Hunter Biden despite our requests. Every witness who has testified and has been asked this has answered, yes. Do you agree that Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest?",02:12,Vindman/Williams
1369,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,"Certainly the potential, yes.",02:43,Vindman/Williams
1370,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,And Ms. Williams?,02:44,Vindman/Williams

1372,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"Now shifting to the legal requirements that our aid to Ukraine is conditioned on anti-corruption. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you testify that you understood that Congress had passed under the Ukrainian security assistance initiative a legal obligation to certify that corruption is being addressed?",02:46,Vindman/Williams
1373,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,03:03,Vindman/Williams
1374,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,And you also testify that it is required by the national defense authorization act?,03:03,Vindman/Williams
1375,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,03:07,Vindman/Williams
1376,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"So for the public listening, we are not just talking about president Trump focusing on anti-corruption in Ukraine, but it is so critical, so important, that hard earned taxpayer dollars when given to foreign nations that by-law overwhelmingly bipartisan support requires anti-corruption in Ukraine in order to get U.S. tax payer funded aid. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you spoke extensively about the importance of defensive lethal aid to Ukraine specifically javelins. This was in your deposition?",03:08,Vindman/Williams
1377,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,03:37,Vindman/Williams
1378,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"And you testified that the javelin in particular, because of its effectiveness in terms of influencing the Russian decision calculus for aggression, it is one of the most important tools we had have when it comes to providing defensive, lethal aid?",03:39,Vindman/Williams
1379,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,"The system itself and the signaling of U.S. support, yes.",03:53,Vindman/Williams
1380,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,And it is a fact that that aid was provided under president Trump and not president Obama.,03:56,Vindman/Williams
1381,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,04:02,Vindman/Williams
1382,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"And my last question, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I know you serve at the NSC in the White House. I served in the West wing of the white house for president Bush on the domestic policy council and in the chief of staff’s office, so I’m very familiar with the policy process. I also know that as a staff member, the person who sets the policy of the the United States is the president, not the staff. And you testify that the president sets the policy, correct?",04:02,Vindman/Williams
1383,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,04:24,Vindman/Williams
1384,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"And I respect your deep expertise, your tremendous service to our country. We can never repay those that have worn the military uniform and served our nation. But I was struck when you testified in your deposition. I would say first of all, I’m the director for Ukraine. I’m responsible for Ukraine. I’m the most knowledgeable, I’m the authority for Ukraine, for the national security council and the White House. I just want a clarification. You report to Tim Morrison, correct?",04:25,Vindman/Williams
1385,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,In my advisory [crosstalk 00:00:04:54].,04:54,Vindman/Williams

1387,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,"Just to clarify, only in my advisory capacity, I advise up through the chain of command. That’s what I do.",04:56,Vindman/Williams
1388,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,"And the chain of command is Tim Morrison to ambassador John Bolton, the national security advisor to the president of United States.",05:02,Vindman/Williams
1389,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,05:09,Vindman/Williams
1390,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,And do you agree that the president sets the policy as commander in chief as you testified previously?,05:09,Vindman/Williams
1391,Section_28,Alexander Vindman,Absolutely.,05:14,Vindman/Williams
1392,Section_28,Elise Stefanik,Thank you. My time’s expired.,05:14,Vindman/Williams
1393,Section_28,John Ratcliffe,"Thank you, Chairman. Ms. Williams, you testified that what you noted as being unusual about the call that took place on July 25th was that the president raised what appeared to be a domestic political issue, correct?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1394,Section_29,Jennifer Williams,Correct.,00:16,Vindman/Williams
1395,Section_29,John Ratcliffe,"But raising an issue, even one that you thought was unusual, is different than making a demand. Would you agree?",00:18,Vindman/Williams
1396,Section_29,Jennifer Williams,Yes.,00:26,Vindman/Williams
1397,Section_29,John Ratcliffe,"And as I read your deposition, it didn’t sound like, from your testimony, that you heard what took place on that call as a demand for investigations. Is that fair?",00:27,Vindman/Williams
1398,Section_29,Jennifer Williams,I don’t believe I’m in a position to characterize it further than the president did in terms of asking for a favor.,00:40,Vindman/Williams
1399,Section_29,John Ratcliffe,You didn’t hear a demand?,00:47,Vindman/Williams
1400,Section_29,Jennifer Williams,"Again, I would just refer back to the transcript itself.",00:49,Vindman/Williams
1401,Section_29,John Ratcliffe,"Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you’ve testified and explained to us why, in your mind, it was a demand. And you’ve given us reasons, a disparity of power between the two presidents. And because you did feel that way, you also felt that you had a duty to report what you thought was improper. Is that correct?",00:53,Vindman/Williams
1402,Section_29,Alexander Vindman,That’s correct.,01:13,Vindman/Williams
1403,Section_29,John Ratcliffe,"Okay. So two different people, two impartial observers. One felt the need to report the call because there was a demand that was improper, and one that didn’t report it to anyone. You didn’t report it to anyone, right, Ms. Williams?",01:14,Vindman/Williams
1404,Section_29,Jennifer Williams,I ensured that the information was available to my superiors.,01:31,Vindman/Williams
1405,Section_29,John Ratcliffe,"So while all this might seem as clear as mud, I think your honest and candid assessments of what you heard on the call tells us what we need to know. We have two independent folks, non-partisans, and I’m not hearing a consensus between the two of you about what exactly you both heard on the call that you heard at the exact same time. And if you can’t reach an agreement with regard to what happened on the call, how can any of us? An impeachment inquiry is supposed to be clear. It’s supposed to be obvious. It’s supposed to be overwhelming and compelling. And if two people on the call disagree honestly about whether or not there was a demand, and whether or not anything should be reported on a call, that is not a clear and compelling basis to undo 63 million votes and remove a president from office.",01:35,Vindman/Williams
1406,Section_29,John Ratcliffe,I yield my remaining time to Mr. Jordan.,02:30,Vindman/Williams
1407,Section_29,Jim Jordan,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Colonel Vindman, why didn’t you go, after the call, why didn’t you go to Mr. Morrison?",02:33,Vindman/Williams
1408,Section_29,Alexander Vindman,"I went immediately, per the instructions from the July 10th incident, I went immediately to Mr. Eisenberg. After that, once I expressed my concerns, it was an extremely busy week. We had a PCC just finish, we had the call, and then we had a deputies meeting, which consumed all of my time. I was working extremely long days. I attempted to try to communicate, I managed to speak to two folks in the interagency. I attempted to try to talk to Mr. Morrison. That didn’t happen before I received instructions from John Eisenberg to not talk to anybody else any further.",02:40,Vindman/Williams
1409,Section_29,Jim Jordan,"So the lawyer, you not only didn’t go to your boss, you said you tried, but you didn’t go to your boss, you went straight to the lawyer and the lawyer told you not to go to your boss?",03:23,Vindman/Williams
1410,Section_29,Alexander Vindman,"No, he didn’t tell me until … What ended up unfolding is I had the conversation with the attorney, I did my coordination, my core function, which is coordination. I spoke to the appropriate people within the interagency. And then, circling back around, Mr. Eisenberg came back to me and told me not to talk to anybody else.",03:32,Vindman/Williams
1411,Section_29,Jim Jordan,"I’m going to read from the transcript here. “Why didn’t you go to your direct report?” Mr. Morrison. Your response was, this is page 102, “Because Mr. Eisenberg had told me to take my concerns to him.”",03:51,Vindman/Williams
1412,Section_29,Jim Jordan,"“And I ask you, did Mr. Eisenberg tell you not to report, to go around Mr. Morrison?”",04:00,Vindman/Williams

1414,Section_29,Jim Jordan,Is that right?,04:09,Vindman/Williams
1415,Section_29,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, but there’s a whole, there’s a period of time in there between when I spoke to him and when he circled back around. It wasn’t that long a period of time, but it was enough time for me to [crosstalk 00:04:21]-",04:10,Vindman/Williams
1416,Section_29,Jim Jordan,"Enough time to go to talk to someone that you won’t tell us who it is, right?",04:21,Vindman/Williams
1417,Section_29,Alexander Vindman,"I have been instructed not to, Representative Jordan.",04:24,Vindman/Williams
1418,Section_29,Jim Jordan,"Well, here’s what I’m getting. The lawyer told you, “Don’t talk to any other people,” and you interpret that as not talking to your boss, but you talk to your brother, you talk to the lawyers, you talk to Secretary Kent, and you talk to the one guy Adam Schiff won’t let you tell us who he is. Is that right?",04:28,Vindman/Williams
1419,Section_29,Alexander Vindman,"Representative Jordan, I did my job.",04:45,Vindman/Williams
1420,Section_29,Jim Jordan,"I’m not saying you didn’t. All I’m saying is the instructions from the lawyer was, “You shouldn’t talk to anybody,” and you interpret that as, “Don’t talk to my boss, but I’m going to go talk to someone,” that we can’t even ask you who that individual is.",04:47,Vindman/Williams
1421,Section_29,Alexander Vindman,That is incorrect.,05:02,Vindman/Williams
1422,Section_29,Jim Jordan,"Well, I just read what you said.",05:03,Vindman/Williams

1435,Section_29,Chris Stewart,"Thank you Miss Williams, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and thank to both of you for being here today. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I see you’re wearing your dress uniform. Knowing that’s not the uniform of the day, do you normally wear a suit to the White House? I think it’s a great reminder of your military service. I, too, come from a military family. These are my father’s Air Force wings. He was a pilot in World War II. Five of his son served in the military, so as one military family to another, thank you and your brothers for your service. Your example here … Very quickly, I’m curious, when ranking member Nunez referred you as Mr. Vindman, you quickly corrected him and wanted to be called Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. Do you always insist on civilians calling you by your rank?",00:00,Vindman/Williams

1437,Section_30,Chris Stewart,I’m sure he meant no disrespect.,00:52,Vindman/Williams
1438,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,"I’m sorry, Mr. Stewart. I apologize. I don’t believe he did, but the attacks that I’ve had in the press, in Twitter have either marginalized me as a military officer or-",00:55,Vindman/Williams
1439,Section_30,Chris Stewart,"Listen, I’m just telling you that the ranking member meant no disrespect to you.",01:08,Vindman/Williams
1440,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,I believe that.,01:13,Vindman/Williams
1441,Section_30,Chris Stewart,"I’d like to go back to your previous testimony earlier today. Much has been talked about, as we’ve discussed, between the President Trump and President Zelensky, and the word favor, and this being interpreted as a basis for impeachment. And your interpretation of the word favor, and I’ll paraphrase you and you feel free to correct me, you said in the military culture, which you and I are both familiar with, when a superior officer asks for a favor of a subordinate and they will interpret that as a demand. Is that a fair synopsis of what you previously stated?",01:14,Vindman/Williams
1442,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,"Representative when a superior makes a request, that’s an order.",01:46,Vindman/Williams
1443,Section_30,Chris Stewart,"Okay. In short then, you think your interpretation of a favor as a demand is based on your military experience and the military culture.",01:50,Vindman/Williams
1444,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,I think that is correct.,01:59,Vindman/Williams
1445,Section_30,Chris Stewart,I think that is correct. Is President Trump a member of the military?,02:00,Vindman/Williams
1446,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,He is not.,02:04,Vindman/Williams
1447,Section_30,Chris Stewart,Has he ever served in the military?,02:05,Vindman/Williams
1448,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,Not that I’m aware of.,02:07,Vindman/Williams
1449,Section_30,Chris Stewart,Is President Zelensky a member of the military? The answer’s no.,02:08,Vindman/Williams
1450,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,I don’t believe so. I don’t know.,02:11,Vindman/Williams
1451,Section_30,Chris Stewart,"He’s not. Would it be fair then to take a person who has never served in the military and to take your reevaluation of their words based on your military experience and your military culture, and to attach that culture and that meaning of those words to someone who has never served?",02:13,Vindman/Williams
1452,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,"Representative, I made that judgment. I stick by that judgment.",02:34,Vindman/Williams
1453,Section_30,Chris Stewart,"Okay, well, I got to tell you, I think it’s nonsense. Look, I was in the military. I could distinguish between a favor, and an order, and a demand, and so could my subordinates, and I think President Zelensky did as well. He never initiated an investigation. In fact, he’s been very clear. He said, “I never felt any pressure at all.” So you interpreted the word favor, but the two people who were speaking to each other did not interpret that as a demand. It was your interpretation. Is that fair?",02:38,Vindman/Williams
1454,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,"The context of this call, consistent with the July 10th meeting with the reporting that was going on, including the President’s personal attorney, made it clear that this was not simply a request.",03:09,Vindman/Williams
1455,Section_30,Chris Stewart,"Well that’s not true at all. It’s not clear at all. You say it makes it clear. It’s not clear at all. And the two individuals who were talking to each other didn’t interpret it that way. I’d like to go on to discuss your reaction to the phone call, and again your previous testimony. And for brevity and for clarity I’m going to refer to your previous testimony of page 155. Your attorney’s welcome to follow along. Quoting you, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. “I did not know whether this was a crime or anything of that nature. I thought it was wrong,” and I’d like to key on the word wrong here because we’re going to come back to that, “In my mind did I consider this factor that it could have been other implications. Yes, but it wasn’t the basis of, I don’t know, lodging a criminal complaint or anything like that.” Then you go on to talk about policy concerns and moral and ethical judgements.",03:24,Vindman/Williams
1456,Section_30,Chris Stewart,"So, your concerns regarding this phone call were not legal. They were based on moral, ethical, and policy differences. Let me ask you then … And you what you thought were wrong, to use your word. You said this was wrong. Not illegal but wrong. There are, as I’ve stated previous sitting here a couple of days ago, there are dozens of corrupt nations in the world, hundreds of corrupt government officials. Exactly one time did a vice president go to a nation and demand the specific firing of one individual and give a six hour time limit and withhold, or threatened to withhold, $1 billion in aid if not. It was the one individual who was a investigating company that was paying his son. So I’ll ask you was that also wrong?",04:11,Vindman/Williams
1457,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,That is not what I understand. I frankly don’t have any firsthand knowledge of that.,04:59,Vindman/Williams
1458,Section_30,Chris Stewart,You’ve not seen the video?,05:04,Vindman/Williams
1459,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,I’ve seen the video.,05:05,Vindman/Williams
1460,Section_30,Chris Stewart,That’s all I’ve described is the video. Everything I just said to you was in the video. Was that wrong as well?,05:07,Vindman/Williams
1461,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,"Congressmen, this is something I actually participated in.",05:14,Vindman/Williams
1462,Section_30,Chris Stewart,"Well, I think the American people can make a judgment on that, too.",05:17,Vindman/Williams
1463,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,I witnessed. That I don’t know.,05:19,Vindman/Williams
1464,Section_30,Speaker 3,"The time of the gentleman is expired. Colonel Vindman, if you’d like to answer the question, you’re more than welcome.",05:19,Vindman/Williams
1465,Section_30,Alexander Vindman,"I frankly don’t know that much more about that particular incident. I saw the snippet of the video, but I don’t know if I could make a judgment off that.",05:24,Vindman/Williams
1466,Section_30,Brad Wenstrup,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, thank you very much for being here. As an army colonel who served a year in Iraq, I appreciate your service and the sacrifice that you made during that time, and I know the environment. And I understand and appreciate the importance of chain in command. In your deposition, you emphasize the importance of chain in command. You were a direct report to Dr. Fiona Hill and then Mr. Tim Morrison, and they were your seniors, correct?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1467,Section_31,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,00:23,Vindman/Williams
1468,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"When you had concerns about the 7/25 call between the two presidents, you didn’t go to Mr. Morrison about that, did you?",00:25,Vindman/Williams
1469,Section_31,Alexander Vindman,"I immediately went to John Eisenberg, the lead legal counsel.",00:33,Vindman/Williams
1470,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,So that doesn’t seem like chains of command. [crosstalk 00:00:39] In the deposition with-,00:37,Vindman/Williams
1471,Section_31,Alexander Vindman,I’m sorry- [crosstalk 00:00:42].,00:41,Vindman/Williams
1472,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,… page 58 to 60.,00:42,Vindman/Williams
1473,Section_31,Speaker 3,"Excuse me, please allow Colonel Vindman to answer.",00:44,Vindman/Williams
1474,Section_31,Alexander Vindman,"So, I reported it to John Eisenberg. I attempted to report it to Mr. Morrison.",00:46,Vindman/Williams
1475,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"Okay, thank you.",00:53,Vindman/Williams
1476,Section_31,Alexander Vindman,"He didn’t avail himself, and at that point, I was told not to speak-",00:54,Vindman/Williams
1477,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"Well, he did avail himself, and I’ll get into that.",00:58,Vindman/Williams
1478,Section_31,Speaker 3,"Please allow the witness to finish. Colonel, are you finished with your answer?",01:00,Vindman/Williams
1479,Section_31,Alexander Vindman,"Yes, thank you.",01:03,Vindman/Williams
1480,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"Okay. In the Morrison Deposition, on page 58-60, the question was, “Do you know if anyone else on the call went to Eisenberg to express concerns,” and the answer was, “I learned, based on today’s proceedings, based on open-source reporting, which I have no firsthand knowledge if other personnel did raise concerns.” Question, “Who?” Based on open-source, without firsthand knowledge, Alex Vindman, on my staff, the question then, “And he reports to you, correct?” Answer, “He does.” Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s direct report was Mr. Morrison and it didn’t happen. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, in your deposition, page 96, the question was, “Okay, after the call on 7/25, do you have any discussions with Mr. Morrison about your concerns?” Answer, “After the call, I, well, per the, per the exercise in the chain of command and expressing, I immediately went to the senior NSC legal counsel and shared those concerns.” That would be Mr. Eisenberg, correct?",01:06,Vindman/Williams
1481,Section_31,Alexander Vindman,"I’m sorry, my lawyer was talking. Could you say that again please, doctor?",02:08,Vindman/Williams
1482,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"You went to Mr. Eisenberg. You’ve already said that, so we can go on. And you are not a JAG officer, you’re not a lawyer. And on page 153 of your testimony, deposition, in reference to that meeting with Mr. Eisenberg, you said, “I was not making a legal judgment. All I was doing is sharing my concerns with my chain of command,” yet we’ve established that your direct report is to Mr. Morrison. So let’s establish your role and your title. In your deposition, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, page 200, 201, in a colloquy with Mr. Stewart, you said, “I would say first of all, I’m the director for Ukraine. I’m responsible for Ukraine. I’m the most knowledgeable, for the national security council and the White House.” Are you the only one of the entire universe of our government or otherwise that can advise the president on Ukraine? Couldn’t someone like Mrs. Williams also advise on Ukraine? It’s in her portfolio.",02:12,Vindman/Williams
1483,Section_31,Alexander Vindman,"That’s not typically what would happen. It would be, frankly, it would be ambassador Bolton-",03:12,Vindman/Williams
1484,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"So other people can advise on Ukraine besides you? Going on in your testimony, you said, “I understand all the nuances, the context, and so forth surrounding these issues. I, on my judgment, went. I expressed concerns within the chain of command, which I think, to me, as a military officer, is completely appropriate. And I exercised that chain of command.” Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, on your deposition, page 259, you said, “I forwarded my concerns through the chain of command, and the seniors then decide the action to take.”",03:17,Vindman/Williams
1485,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"Mr. Morrison’s your senior. He didn’t know about it. How can he decide an action to take, but that’s what you said. In Mr. Morrison’s deposition, page 60, the question is, “At what point did you learn that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman went to Eisenberg?” He said, “About the 25th phone call?” He said, “Yes.” “In the course of reviewing for this proceeding, reviewing the open record.”",03:48,Vindman/Williams
1486,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"The next question, “So Eisenberg never came to you and relayed to you the conversation?” He said, “No.” He said, “And Ellis never did either?” “Not to the best of my recollection.” So Mr. Morrison was skipped in your chain of command about your other concerns. Mr. Morrison said he’s the final clearing authority. He said he saw your edits. Do you remember if all of the edits were incorporated? And he said, “Yes, I accepted all of them.” That’s on page 61, 62.",04:12,Vindman/Williams
1487,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"He believes all your edits were accepted. Let me ask, in your edits, did you insist that the word demand be put into the transcription between the conversation of the two presidents?",04:43,Vindman/Williams
1488,Section_31,Alexander Vindman,I did not.,04:54,Vindman/Williams
1489,Section_31,Brad Wenstrup,"But you did say that in your opening statement today. Thank you, and I yield back.",04:56,Vindman/Williams
1490,Section_31,Michael Turner,Ms. Williams. Lt. Col. Vindman. I want to thank you also for your service. Your knowledge and expertise is incredibly important as we look to formulating policy with both our allies and to try to counter those who are not our allies. I think we’re all very concerned about our European policy and how it can thwart Russian aggression.,00:00,Vindman/Williams
1491,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Ms. Williams, and you are responsible, as you said as part of your portfolio, you advised the vice president about Ukraine. Correct?",00:19,Vindman/Williams
1492,Section_32,Jennifer Williams,Correct.,00:25,Vindman/Williams
1493,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Lt. Col. Vindman, you said that you are the principal… In your opening, you say you are the principal advisor to the president on Ukraine and you coordinate US-Ukraine policy. Correct?",00:26,Vindman/Williams
1494,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,"Yeah. Congressman in this statement I issued this morning, I’d probably ease that back. I took that off my job description that I have on my eval, but I certainly spent much more time advising the ambassador than I did the president. I had no [crosstalk 00:00:50].",00:37,Vindman/Williams
1495,Section_32,Michael Turner,"But your statement as you submitted it and read it today says, “At the NSC, I am the principal advisor to the national security advisor and the president on Ukraine.” Correct?",00:51,Vindman/Williams
1496,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,"That is not what I read into the transcript. That might’ve been what I had in there yesterday when I was drafting it, but I chose to ease back on that language even though it was in my evaluation just because I didn’t want to overstate my role.",01:01,Vindman/Williams
1497,Section_32,Michael Turner,But you wrote this? You wrote what I just read?,01:14,Vindman/Williams
1498,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,"But Congressman, what I’m saying is what I read into the record this morning didn’t say that.",01:16,Vindman/Williams
1499,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Okay. Noted. Because you know Ukraine, you know that we work through our allies and our multilateral relations and you know that the Ukraine is aspiring member of the EU and NATO. Right, Ms. Williams?",01:22,Vindman/Williams
1500,Section_32,Jennifer Williams,"Yes, that’s correct.",01:38,Vindman/Williams
1501,Section_32,Michael Turner,Lt. Col. Vindman?,01:38,Vindman/Williams
1502,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,Yes. Correct.,01:41,Vindman/Williams
1503,Section_32,Michael Turner,"And you know that probably that the EU and NATO both have offices in the Ukraine and that we tried to advance our policy with the EU and NATO. And you would agree that our ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchison and ambassador Sondland would be responsible for advancing our policy interest with Ukraine at the EU and at NATO. Right, Ms. Williams?",01:42,Vindman/Williams
1504,Section_32,Jennifer Williams,"I would say that certainly in terms of the specific relationship between NATO and Ukraine, that would fall to ambassador Hutchison. And between the EU and Ukraine to ambassador Sondland. But obviously we have an ambassador in Ukraine as well.",02:05,Vindman/Williams
1505,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Right. Lt. Col. Vindman, you would agree?",02:19,Vindman/Williams
1506,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,I agree with Ms. Williams.,02:21,Vindman/Williams
1507,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Great. Now Lt. Col., you said in your written statement, that mayor Rudolph Giuliani promoted false information that undermined the United States-Ukraine policy. Have you ever met Giuliani?",02:22,Vindman/Williams
1508,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,"Just to be again accurate. I said, “False narrative.” Just because that’s what I said in the record this morning. But I have not met him.",02:37,Vindman/Williams
1509,Section_32,Michael Turner,"And so you’ve never had a conversation with him about Ukraine, or been in a meeting with him where he has spoken to others about Ukraine?",02:43,Vindman/Williams
1510,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,"Ah, no. Just what I saw him… his comments on TV…",02:48,Vindman/Williams
1511,Section_32,Michael Turner,So news reports?,02:53,Vindman/Williams
1512,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,…and the news. Yes.,02:54,Vindman/Williams
1513,Section_32,Michael Turner,"And similarly, you’ve never met the president of the United States, right?",02:55,Vindman/Williams
1514,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,02:57,Vindman/Williams
1515,Section_32,Michael Turner,So you’ve never advised the president of the United States on Ukraine?,02:58,Vindman/Williams
1516,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,I advised him indirectly. I made all his preparations for the calls and for his engagements.,03:01,Vindman/Williams
1517,Section_32,Michael Turner,But you’ve never spoken to the president of the United States and told him advice on Ukraine?,03:05,Vindman/Williams
1518,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,03:09,Vindman/Williams
1519,Section_32,Michael Turner,"So in your written statement, you said, “In May, I attended the inauguration of president Zelensky as part of the president delegation led by secretary Perry. Following the visit, the members of the delegation provided president Trump a debriefing.” Well, that’s not really accurate, right? Because the members didn’t, because you were a member, but you weren’t in that meeting, were you?",03:10,Vindman/Williams
1520,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,That is correct.,03:27,Vindman/Williams
1521,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Okay, so we’ll just have a note there that that meeting occurred without you. You do know that this impeachment inquiry is about the president of the United States, don’t you Lt. Col. Vindman?",03:28,Vindman/Williams
1522,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,"I do, representative.",03:37,Vindman/Williams
1523,Section_32,Michael Turner,Great. Excellent. Now you’ve said that you’re responsible for coordinating US-Ukrainian policy.,03:38,Vindman/Williams
1524,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,Correct.,03:43,Vindman/Williams
1525,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Does the secretary of state, Pompeo report to you?",03:44,Vindman/Williams
1526,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,He does not.,03:48,Vindman/Williams
1527,Section_32,Michael Turner,Ambassador Volker?,03:49,Vindman/Williams
1528,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,He does not. We coordinate but…,03:52,Vindman/Williams
1529,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Ambassador of Ukraine, EU, NATO, assistant secretary for Europe, anyone at DOD report to you with respect to your responsibilities of coordinating US policy with Ukraine?",03:53,Vindman/Williams
1530,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,"Congressman, at my level, I convene what’s called a sub policy coordinating committee. That’s deputy assistant secretary. I coordinate with… I chair those meetings and I bring together those folks.",04:03,Vindman/Williams
1531,Section_32,Michael Turner,Does anybody need your approval in your role on Ukraine policy to formulate Ukraine policy? Do they seek your approval?,04:11,Vindman/Williams
1532,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,"According to the NSPM 4, the policy signed by the president…",04:18,Vindman/Williams
1533,Section_32,Michael Turner,So he gets to do it?,04:23,Vindman/Williams
1534,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,…policy should be coordinated by the…,04:23,Vindman/Williams
1535,Section_32,Michael Turner,He should do it?,04:24,Vindman/Williams
1536,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,…by the NSC. Correct? We help advise him.,04:25,Vindman/Williams
1537,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Ms. Williams, do you have any information that any person who has testified as part of this impeachment inquiry, either in secret, or in public, has either perjured themselves, or lied to this committee?",04:28,Vindman/Williams
1538,Section_32,Jennifer Williams,I have not read the other testimonies and I…,04:41,Vindman/Williams
1539,Section_32,Michael Turner,"So you do not. Do you have any evidence though that they have perjured themselves, or lied?",04:43,Vindman/Williams
1540,Section_32,Jennifer Williams,"No, because I have not read them.",04:48,Vindman/Williams
1541,Section_32,Michael Turner,"Lt. Col. Vindman, do you have any evidence that anyone who has testified before this committee in the impeachment inquiry has perjured themselves, or lied to this committee?",04:50,Vindman/Williams
1542,Section_32,Alexander Vindman,Not that I’m aware of.,04:58,Vindman/Williams
1543,Section_32,Michael Turner,Thank you. I yield back.,04:59,Vindman/Williams
1544,Section_32,Rep. Demings,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. First of all, Ms. Williams, let me thank you for your service to our nation. It it truly matters.",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1545,Section_33,Jennifer Williams,Thank you.,00:08,Vindman/Williams
1546,Section_33,Rep. Demings,"Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I had the honor of speaking to a group of veterans this past weekend and what I said to them was that no words, no words are really adequate or sufficient to fully express our gratitude for their service to our nation. So Lieutenant Colonel Vindman today I say to you, there are no words that are sufficient to fully express our gratitude to you for what you have done for our nation and amazingly what you are still willing to do for our nation.",00:08,Vindman/Williams
1547,Section_33,Rep. Demings,It is vitally important that the American people understand how President Trump’s unethical demand that Ukraine deliver politically motivated investigations in exchange for military assistance created our security risks for our the United States of America national security. The President was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with Ukraine. Threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that Congress had appropriated has real life consequences for Ukraine and for the USA.,00:53,Vindman/Williams
1548,Section_33,Rep. Demings,"In you’re deposition, Colonel Vindman, you testified, and I quote, “A strong and independent Ukraine is critical to our security interests.” Could you please explain why a strong and independent Ukraine is so critical and why it is so vital to us interests?",01:38,Vindman/Williams
1549,Section_33,Alexander Vindman,"We sometimes refer to Ukraine as a frontline state. It’s on the front line of Europe. They have actually described it to me, the Ukrainians, that it is a… they consider themselves as a barrier between Russian aggression and Europe. And what I’ve heard them describe is the need for US support in order to serve this role in order to protect European and Western security.",02:01,Vindman/Williams
1550,Section_33,Rep. Demings,"Lieutenant Colonel, this is not just a theoretical conflict between Ukraine and Russia. You’ve already said this morning that Russia is actively fighting to expand into Ukraine, that Ukraine is in a hot war with Russia right now. Is that correct?",02:33,Vindman/Williams
1551,Section_33,Alexander Vindman,"It’s stable, but it’s still a hot war.",02:52,Vindman/Williams
1552,Section_33,Rep. Demings,"And isn’t it true a Lieutenant Colonel, that even if the security was eventually delivered to Ukraine, the fact that it was delayed, just that fact, could signal to Russia that the bond between Ukraine and the US was weakening?",02:55,Vindman/Williams
1553,Section_33,Alexander Vindman,That was the concern of myself and my colleagues.,03:12,Vindman/Williams
1554,Section_33,Rep. Demings,"And was the risk of even the appearance that the US Ukraine bond is shaky, is that it could embolden Russia to act with more aggression? Would you say that’s correct?",03:16,Vindman/Williams
1555,Section_33,Alexander Vindman,I believe that was my testimony.,03:28,Vindman/Williams
1556,Section_33,Rep. Demings,"Just last month during an interview. President Putin joked about interfering in our political elections. I can only guess that’s what we have become to Russia and its president. I think he felt emboldened by the President’s reckless actions, both attempts to hold critical military aid from Ukraine and President Trump’s effort to blame a Ukraine, not Russia for election interference.",03:30,Vindman/Williams
1557,Section_33,Rep. Demings,"Ms. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. I can only say that every American, regardless of our politics, should be critically concerned about that. And let me just say this. Yes, we do trust the American people. But you know what? The American people trust us to as members of Congress to support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and we intend to do just that. Thank you again for your service. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.",04:03,Vindman/Williams
1558,Section_33,Patrick Maloney,"Thank you both for being here. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, this may be one of your first congressional hearings like this, so you may not understand-",00:01,Vindman/Williams
1559,Section_33,Alexander Vindman,Hopefully the last.,00:15,Vindman/Williams
1560,Section_33,Patrick Maloney,"I can’t blame you for feeling that way, sir, particularly when I’ve been sitting here listening to my Republican colleagues. One of the advantages of being down here at the kid’s table is that you get to hear the folks above you ask their questions. And I’ve been listening closely to my Republican colleagues and I’ve heard them say just about everything, except to contradict any of the substantive testimony you’ve both given.",00:18,Vindman/Williams
1561,Section_33,Patrick Maloney,"You may have noticed there’s been a lot of complaints and there’s been a lot of insinuations and there’s been a lot of suggestions maybe that your service is somehow not to be trusted. You were treated to questions about your loyalty because of some half-baked job offer I guess the Ukrainians made you, which you of course dutifully reported. I guess Mr. [Caster 00:01:03] is implying maybe you’ve got some dual loyalty, which is of course an old smear we’ve heard many times in our history.",00:42,Vindman/Williams
1562,Section_33,Patrick Maloney,"They tried to demean you as though maybe you’ve overstated your importance of your job. Of course, you are the guy on the National Security Council responsible for directing Ukrainian policy. We’ve heard them air out some allegations with no basis and proof, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti, I guess, will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them. We’ve even had a member of this committee question … this is my favorite, question why you would wear your dress uniform today, even though that dress uniform includes a breast plate that has a combat infantry badge on it and a purple heart medal ribbon.",01:10,Vindman/Williams

Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I’m concerned that your loyalty has been questioned not just because you’re bringing forward evidence of wrongdoing against the President of the United States, but because you’re an immigrant. Recently, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade said, “He,” meaning you, “were born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family young. He tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.” I find this statement reprehensible because it appears that your immigrant heritage is being used against you. Lieutenant Colonel, I came to this country when I was three months old. Your family fled the Soviet Union and moved to America when you were just three and a half years old, right?",00:00,Vindman/Williams

1639,Section_34,Alexander Vindman,Superb individual.,04:14,Vindman/Williams

First of all, I want to join my colleagues in thanking you, Colonel Vindman for your military service, and I should tell you that not withstanding all of the questions you got on, why didn’t you go talk to your supervisor? Why didn’t you go talk to Mr. Morrison? Why did you go to the national security lawyer? As if there’s something wrong with going to the national security lawyer? Are you aware that we asked Mr. Morrison whether he went to the national security lawyer right after the call, and that he did?",00:00,Vindman/Williams
1648,Section_35,Alexander Vindman,I am.,00:54,Vindman/Williams
1649,Section_35,Adam Schiff,"And are you aware also that we asked him, well, if you had this problem with Colonel Vindman not going to you instead of the lawyer, naturally you must’ve gone to your supervisor. And you know what his answer was? He didn’t go to his supervisor either. He went directly to the national security council lawyers. I hope my colleagues will give him the same hard time for not following his chain of command that he complained about with you apparently. The president may attack you and has, others on Right-Wing TV might attack you, and they have, but I thought you should know and maybe you know already that this is what the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had to say about you Colonel Vindman, “He is a professional, competent, patriotic, and loyal officer. He has made an extraordinary contribution to the security of our nation in both peacetime and combat.” I’m sure your dad is proud to hear that.",00:56,Vindman/Williams
1650,Section_35,Adam Schiff,"My colleagues have tried to make the argument here today and we’ve heard it before, that the president was just interested in fighting corruption. That’s our goal, fighting corruption in Ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. The problem of course with that is there’s no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption. The evidence all points in the other direction, the evidence points in the direction of the president inviting Ukraine to engage in the corrupt act of investigating a US political opponent.",01:55,Vindman/Williams
1651,Section_35,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador Yovanavitch was known as a strong fighter of corruption. So what does the president do? He recalls her from her post. Ambassador Yovanovich in fact was at a meeting celebrating other anticorruption fighters, including a woman who had acid thrown in her face on the day she was told to get on the next plane back to Washington. You prepare talking points for the president’s first conversation with Zelinsky. He supposed to talk about rooting up corruption. If this president had such a deep interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, surely he would have brought it up on the call. But of course, we now know that he did not.",02:27,Vindman/Williams
1652,Section_35,Adam Schiff,"We then see Rudy Giuliani not fighting corruption, but asking for an investigation of the Bidens. And my colleagues say, “Well, maybe he was acting on his own,” even though he says he’s acting as the president’s lawyer. Maybe he was really acting on his own. But the two investigations that Rudy Giuliani wanted, come up in the meeting you participate in on July 10th at the white house when a Ambassador Sonnen brings up the Bidens and Brisbois and 2016. Tells the Ukrainians who want that meeting, the white house, you’ve got to do these investigations. Now they would say ambassadors Sonnen was acting on his own, but that doesn’t quite work either because we have the call record from July 25th, which the president was forced to release in which the president doesn’t bring up corruption. He doesn’t say, “How are those anti-corruption cords going?” Or “Great work in the RADA.” Of course not.",03:10,Vindman/Williams
1653,Section_35,Adam Schiff,"What does the president’s say? I want you to investigate the Bidens and this debunk conspiracy theory pushed by Vladimir Putin, that also helps me in my reelection. So much for fighting corruption. The message to Ukraine, the real message to Ukraine, our US policy message is, don’t engage in political investigations. The message from the president, however, was the exact opposite. Do engage in political investigations and do it for my reelection. And it’s also made clear if they want the white house meeting and ultimately if they want 400 million in USAID, this is what they have to do.",04:04,Vindman/Williams
1654,Section_35,Adam Schiff,"The only lament I hear from my colleagues is, it wasn’t successful. They got caught. They didn’t get the political infestations and they still had to release the money. Now, they still haven’t gotten the white house meeting, but they had to release the money because a whistleblower blew the whistle. Whistleblower the president wants to punish and because Congress announced it was doing investigations and very soon thereafter, the president was forced to lift the hold on the aid. They argue, well, this makes it okay. That it was a failed effort to bribe Ukraine, a failed effort to extort Ukraine. That doesn’t make it better. It’s no less odious because it was discovered and it was stopped.",04:42,Vindman/Williams
1655,Section_35,Adam Schiff,"And we have courageous people like yourself who come forward, who report things, who do what they should do, who have a sense as you put it, Colonel, of duty, of duty, not to the person of the president, but to the presidency and to the country. And we thank you for that.",05:25,Vindman/Williams
1656,Section_35,Adam Schiff,"At the end of the day, I think this all comes back to something we heard from another career foreign service officer just last Friday. In a conversation he overheard with the president in a restaurant in Ukraine, in which the president, not Rudy Giuliani, not anyone else, the president of the United States wanted to know are they going to do the investigations? This is the day after that July 25th call. Are they going to do the investigations and he’s insured by ambassador Sonnen, that they’re going to do it. And what does Sonnen relate to this foreign service officer after he hangs up that call? The president doesn’t give a expletive about Ukraine. He only cares about the big things that help his personal interests.",05:47,Vindman/Williams
1657,Section_35,Adam Schiff,"That’s all you need to know. And it isn’t just about Ukraine. Of course, Ukraine is fighting our fight against the Russians, against their expansionism. That’s our fight too. That’s our fight too, at least we thought so on a bipartisan basis. That’s our fight too. That’s why we support Ukraine with a military aid that we have.",06:38,Vindman/Williams

For those of you who have been watching it at home, the Democrats are no closer to impeachment than where they were three years ago. In the process, they’ve … The Department of Justice, FBI, State Department, elements within the IC, the ICIG, have all suffered longterm damage. The Democrats can continue to poison the American people with this nonsense. We sat here all morning without any evidence for impeachment, which would be a very serious crime. “High crime and misdemeanors,” as it says in the Constitution. No such thing.",00:00,Vindman/Williams

I appreciate the minority’s request for these two important witnesses as well as under secretary of state David Hale from whom we will hear tomorrow.",01:23,Volker/Morrison
2,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"As we have heard from other witnesses, when Joe Biden was considering whether to enter the race for the presidency in 2020, the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, began a campaign to weaken Vice President Biden’s candidacy by pushing Ukraine to investigate him and his son. To clear away any obstacle to the scheme, days after the new Ukrainian president was elected, Trump ordered the recall of Marie Yovanovitch, the American ambassador in Kyiv who was known for pushing anti-corruption efforts.",01:55,Volker/Morrison
3,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Trump also canceled Vice President Mike Pence’s participation in the inauguration of President Zelensky on May 20th and instead sent a delegation headed by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and ambassador Kurt Volker. These three returned from Kyiv and briefed President Trump on their encouraging first interactions with the new Ukrainian administration. Hopes that Trump would agree to an early meeting with the Ukrainian president were soon diminished, however, when Trump pushed back.",02:25,Volker/Morrison
4,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"According to Volker, he just didn’t believe it. He was skeptical, and he also said, “That’s not what I hear. I hear he’s got some terrible people around him.” President Trump also told them he believed that Ukraine tried to take him down. He told the three Amigos, “Talk to Rudy,” and they did. One of those interactions took place a week before the July 25th phone call between Trump and Zelensky when Ambassador Volker had breakfast with Rudy Giuliani at the Trump Hotel. Volker testified that he pushed back on Giuliani’s accusation against Joe Biden.",02:58,Volker/Morrison
5,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"On July 22nd, just days before Trump would talk to Zelensky, Ambassador Volker had a telephone conference with Giuliani and Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to the Ukrainian president so that Giuliani could be introduced to Yermak. On July 25th, the same day as the call between President Trump and Zelensky, but before it took place, Ambassador Volker sent a text message to Yermak, “Heard from the White House. Assuming president Z convinces Trump, he will investigate/get to the bottom of what happened in 2016. We will nail down date for a visit to Washington. Good luck!”",03:34,Volker/Morrison
6,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Later that day, Donald Trump would have the now-infamous phone call with Zelensky in which he responded to Ukraine’s appreciation for US defense support and a request by President Zelensky to buy more javelin anti-tank missiles by saying, ” I would like you to do us a favor though.” The favor involved the two investigations that Giuliani had been pushing for into the Bidens in 2016. Ambassador Volker was not on the call, but when asked about what it reflected, he testified, “No president of the United States should ask a foreign leader to help interfere in a US election.”",04:13,Volker/Morrison
7,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Among those listening in on the July 25th call was Tim Morrison who had taken over as the NSC senior director for European affairs at the NSC only days before, but had been briefed by his predecessor, Fiona Hill, about the irregular second channel that was operating in parallel to the official one. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams, from whom we heard this morning, like them, Morrison emerged from the call troubled. He was concerned enough about what he heard on the July 25th call that he went to see the NSC legal advisors soon after it had ended.",04:51,Volker/Morrison
8,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Colonel Vindman’s fear was that the president had broken the law potentially, but Morrison said that his concern was that the call could be damaging if it were leaked. Soon after this discussion with lawyers at the NSC, the call record was hidden away on a secure server used to store highly classified intelligence where it remained until late September when the call record was publicly released. Following the July 25th call, Ambassador Volker worked with Sondland and the Ukrainian president’s close adviser, Yermak, on a statement that would satisfy Giuliani. When Yermak sent over a draft that’s still failed to include the specific words Burisma and 2016, Giuliani said the statement would lack credibility. Ambassador Volker then added both Burisma and 2016 to the draft statement. Both Volker and Morrison were, by late July, aware that the security assistance had been cut off at the direction of the president and acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. As the Ukrainians became aware of the suspension of security assistance and the negotiations over the scheduling of a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky dragged on, the pressure increased and any pretense that there was no linkage soon dropped away.",05:26,Volker/Morrison
9,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Morrison accompanied Vice President Pence to Warsaw on September 1st where Pence and Zelensky met, and Zelensky raised the suspended security assistance. Following that meeting, Sondland approached Yermak to tell him that he believed that what could help move the aid was if the Ukrainian prosecutor general would go to the mic and announced that he was opening the Burisma investigation. On September 7th, Ambassador Sondland had a telephone call with Trump and asked him what he wanted from Ukraine.",06:40,Volker/Morrison
10,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"According to Morrison, who spoke with Sondland after the call, Trump insisted that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky must personally announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it. Sondland also said that if President Zelensky didn’t agree to make a public statement about the investigations, the US and Ukraine would be at a stalemate, meaning it would not receive the much-needed security assistance.",07:10,Volker/Morrison
11,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Morrison had a sinking feeling after the call as he realized that the ask was now being directed at Zelensky himself and not the prosecutor general as Sondland had relayed to a senior Ukrainian aid in Warsaw on September 1st. While President Trump claim there was no quid pro quo, his insistence that Zelensky himself must publicly announce the investigations or they’d be at a stalemate made clear that leads to official act White House meeting and 400 million in military aid were conditioned on receipt of what Trump wanted, the investigations to help his campaign.",07:37,Volker/Morrison
12,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"The efforts to secure the investigations would continue for several more days, but appear to have abruptly ended soon after the three committees of Congress announced an investigation into the Trump-Giuliani Ukraine scheme only then would the aide be released.

We are here to continue what the Democrats tell us is a serious, somber, and even prayerful process of attempting to overthrow a duly elected president.

14,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Isn’t it strange how we’ve morphed into the impeachment committee, presiding over a matter that has no intelligent component whatsoever? Impeachment, of course, is the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee, not the intelligence committee, but putting this sparse in our court provides two main advantages for the Democrats. It made it easier for them to shroud their depositions in secrecy and it allowed them to avoid giving too big of a role in this spectacle to another Democrat committee chairman, and whom the Democrat leaders obviously have no confidence.",09:10,Volker/Morrison

They are being conducted by Democrats who spent three years saturating the airwaves with dire warnings that President Trump is a Russian agent and these outlandish attacks continue to this very day.

16,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"How can anyone believe that people who would utter such dramatic absurdities are conducting a fair impeachment process and are only trying to discover the truth? It’s obvious the Democrats are trying to topple the president solely because they despise him because they’ve promised since election day to impeach him and because they’re afraid he will win re-election next year. No witnesses have identified any crime or impeachable offense committed by the president, but that doesn’t matter.",10:22,Volker/Morrison
17,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Last week, the Democrats told us his infraction was asking for a quid pro quo. This week, it’s bribery. Who knows what ridiculous crime they’ll be accusing him of next week? As witnesses, the Democrats have called a parade of government officials who don’t like President Trump’s Ukraine policy, even though they acknowledge he provided Ukraine with lethal military aid after the Obama administration refused to do so. They also resent his conduct of policy through channels outside their own authority and control. These actions they argue contradict the so-called interagency consensus.",10:59,Volker/Morrison
18,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"They don’t seem to understand that the president alone is constitutionally vested with the authority to set the policy. The American people elect a president, not an interagency consensus. And of course our previous witnesses had very little new information to share in these hearings, that’s because these hearings are not designed to uncover new information. They’re meant to showcase a handpicked group of witnesses who the Democrats determined through their secret audition process will provide testimony most conductive and conducive to their accusations.",11:45,Volker/Morrison
19,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"In fact, by the time any witness says anything here, people are actually hearing it for the third time. They heard it first through the Democrats cherry- pick leaks to their media sympathizers during the secret depositions and second, when the Democrats publish those deposition transcripts in a highly staged manner. Of course, there are no transcripts from crucial witnesses like Hunter Biden who could testify about his well paying job and the board of a corrupt Ukrainian company, or Alexandra Chalupa who worked on an election meddling scheme with Ukrainian officials on behalf of the democratic national committee and the Clinton campaign. That’s because the Democrats refused to let us hear from them. As for evidence, what we’re left with is the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky phone call, which the president made public. That means Americans can read for themselves an unremarkable conversation with President Zelensky who repeatedly expressed satisfaction with the call afterward. The Democrats, however, claimed President Zelensky was being bribed and therefore, he must be lying when he says the call was friendly and pose no problems.",12:21,Volker/Morrison
20,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"There’s some irony here, for weeks we’ve heard the Democrats bemoan the damage President Trump supposedly caused to the US-Ukrainian relations, but when the Ukrainian president contradicts their accusations, they publicly dismiss him as a liar. I may be wrong, but I’m fairly sure calling a friendly foreign president, newly elected a liar violates their so-called interagency consensus.",13:34,Volker/Morrison
21,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"So overall, the Democrats would have you believe President Zelensky was being blackmailed with a pause on lethal military aide that he didn’t even know about, that President Trump did not mention to him, and that diplomats have testified they always assumed would be lifted, which it was. Without the Ukrainians undertaking any of the actions, they were supposedly being coerced into doing. This process is not serious. It’s not sober and it is certainly not prayerful.",14:05,Volker/Morrison
22,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"It’s an ambitious attack to deprive the American people of the right to elect a president the Democrats don’t like. As I mentioned, chairman of this committee claims that democracy is under threat. If that’s true, it’s not the president who poses the danger. I yield back.",14:37,Volker/Morrison
23,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"I thank the gentlemen. We are joined this afternoon by Ambassador Kurt Volker and Mr. Timothy Morrison. Ambassador Kurt Volker served in the US Foreign Service for nearly 30 years working on European and Eurasian political and security issues under five different presidential administrations. During the George W. Bush administration, he served as the acting director for European and Eurasian affairs in the National Security Council and later as a deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. In 2008, President Bush appointed Ambassador Kurt Volker to the United States permanent representative to NATO where he served until May 2009. In July 2017, Ambassador Kurt Volker was appointed to be the US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations serving in that position until he resigned in September. It is pleasure to welcome Mr. Morrison back to the legislative branch where he served for almost two decades as a Republican staffer. He was a professional staff member for Representative Mark Kennedy of Minnesota, and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona.",15:01,Volker/Morrison
24,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Later, Mr. Morrison served as the longtime policy director for the Republican staff of the House Armed Services Committee. In July 2018, Mr. Morrison joined the National Security Council as senior director for countering weapons of mass destruction. Following the departure of Dr. Fiona Hill in July 2019, Mr. Morrison assumed the position of senior director for Russia and Europe.",16:01,Volker/Morrison
25,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Two final points before the witnesses are sworn. First witness depositions as part of this inquiry were unclassified in nature and all open hearings will also be held at the unclassified level. Any information that may touch on classified information will be addressed separately. Second, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal, threat of reprisal or attempt to retaliate against any US government official for testifying before Congress, including you or any of your colleagues.",16:23,Volker/Morrison
26,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"If you’ll both please rise and raise your right hand, I will begin by swearing you in. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you’re about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Let the record show that the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you and please be seated. The microphones are sensitive so please speak directly into them without objection. Your written statements will also be made part of the record.",16:53,Volker/Morrison
27,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"With that Mr. Morrison, you are recognized for your opening statement and immediately thereafter Ambassador Volker, you’re recognized for your opening statement.",17:24,Volker/Morrison
28,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Chairman Schiff, Ranking Member Nunes and members of the committee, I appear before you today under subpoena to answer your questions about my time as senior director for European affairs at the White House and the National Security Council, as related to Ukraine and US security assistance to that country. I will provide you the most complete and accurate information I can, consistent with my obligations to protect classified and privileged information. Whether the conduct that is the subject of this inquiry merits impeachment is a question for the US House of Representatives.",17:34,Volker/Morrison
29,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I appear here today only to provide factual information based upon my knowledge and recollection of events. I will not waste time restating the details of my opening statement from my deposition on October 31, 2019, which has recently been made public. However, I will highlight the following key points: first, as I previously stated, I do not know who the whistleblower is nor do I intend to speculate as to who the individual may be. Second, I have great respect for my former colleagues from the NSC and the rest of the interagency.",18:04,Volker/Morrison
30,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I am not here today to question their character or integrity. My recollections and judgments are my own. Some of my colleagues’ recollections of conversations and interactions may differ from mine, but I do not view those differences as the result of an untoward purpose. Third, I continue to believe Ukraine is on the front lines of a strategic competition between the West and Vladimir Putin’s revanchist Russia. Russia is a failing power, but it is still a dangerous one. The United States aids Ukraine and her people so they can fight Russia over there and we don’t have to fight Russia here.",18:37,Volker/Morrison
31,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty has been a bipartisan objective since Russia’s military invasion in 2014. It must continue to be. As I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call, on July 25th, how its disclosure would play in Washington’s political climate. My fears have been realized. I understand the gravity of these proceedings, but I beg you not to lose sight of the military conflict underway in Eastern Ukraine today. The ongoing illegal occupation of Crimea and the importance of reform of Ukraine’s politics and economy.",19:12,Volker/Morrison
32,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Every day that the focus of discussion involving Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interest of Ukraine, the United States, and Western-style liberalism share. Finally, I concluded my act of service at the National Security Council the day after I last appeared before you. I left the NSC completely of my own volition. I felt no pressure to resign nor have I feared any retaliation from my testimony. I made this career choice sometime before I decided to testify on October 31st. I’m prepared to answer your questions to the best of my ability and recollection.",19:46,Volker/Morrison
33,Section_0,Adam Schiff,Thank you. Ambassador Volker.,20:26,Volker/Morrison
34,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and ranking member. Thank you very much for the opportunity to provide this testimony today. As you know, I was the first person to come forward to testify as part of this inquiry. I did so voluntarily and likewise voluntarily provided relevant documentation in my possession in order to be as cooperative, clear and complete as possible. I am here today voluntarily and I remain committed to cooperating fully and truthfully with this committee. All I can do is provide the facts as I understood them at the time. I did this on October 3rd in private and I will do so again today.",20:31,Volker/Morrison
35,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Like many others who have testified in this inquiry, I’m a career foreign policy professional. I began my career as an intelligence analyst for Northern Europe for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1986 before joining the state department in 1988. I served in diplomatic postings, primarily focused on European political and security issues for over 20 years under presidents: Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.",21:13,Volker/Morrison
36,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"My last three positions before leaving the senior foreign service in 2009 were as director for NATO in West European affairs at the National Security Council, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs at the state department, and finally, as US ambassador to NATO. In the spring of 2017 then secretary of state, Tillerson, asked if I would come back to government service as US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations. I did this on a part-time, voluntary basis with no salary paid by the US taxpayer simply because I believed it was important to serve our country in this way. I believed I could steer US policy in the right direction. For over two years as US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations, my singular focus was advancing the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States.",21:45,Volker/Morrison
37,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"In particular, that meant pushing back on Russian aggression and supporting the development of a strong, resilient, democratic and prosperous Ukraine, one that overcomes a legacy of corruption and becomes integrated into a wider transatlantic community. This is critically important for US national security. If we can stop and reverse Russian aggression in Ukraine, we can prevent it elsewhere. If Ukraine, the cradle of Slavic civilization pre-dating Moscow succeeds as a freedom, loving, prosperous, and secure democracy, it gives us enormous hope that Russia may one day change, providing a better life for Russian people and overcoming its current plague of authoritarianism, corruption, aggression toward neighbors and threats to NATO in the United States. The stakes for the United States and a successful Ukraine could not be higher.",22:39,Volker/Morrison
38,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took apart in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden. As you know from the extensive realtime documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. I was not made aware of any reference to vice president Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25th, 2019.",23:36,Volker/Morrison
39,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"From July 7, 2017, until September 27th, 2019, I was the lead US diplomat dealing with Russia’s war on Ukraine. My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel. I reported directly to secretaries of state: Tillerson and Pompeo kept the national security advisor and secretary of defense well-informed of my efforts and worked closely with Ambassador Masha Yovanovitch, NSC Senior Director Hill, and her successor, Tim Morrison, then-Assistant Secretary Wess Mitchell and his successor acting Assistant Secretary Phil Reeker, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of defense, Laura Cooper, NSC Director Alex Vindman and many, many others. I have known many of them for several years. It was a team effort.",24:09,Volker/Morrison
40,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"When Ambassador Yovanovitch left Kyiv, I identified and recommended Bill Taylor to Secretary Pompeo, so we would still have a strong seasoned professional on the ground. For two years before the events at the heart of this investigation took place, I was the most senior US diplomat visiting the conflict zone, meeting with victims of Russia’s aggression, urging increased US security assistance, including lethal defensive weapons, working with Ukrainian President Poroshenko and then his successor President Zelensky and their teams, working with France and Germany and the so-called Norman process, pressing for support from NATO, the EU and OSCE, supporting the OSCE special monitoring mission and engaging in negotiations and other contacts with Russian officials.",25:02,Volker/Morrison
41,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"At the time I took the position in the summer of 2017, there were major complicated questions swirling in public debate about the direction of US policy towards Ukraine. Would the administration lifts sanctions against Russia? Would it make some kind of grand bargain with Russia in which it would trade recognition of Russia seizure of Ukrainian territory for some other deal in Syria or elsewhere? Would the administration recognized Russia’s claimed annexation of Crimea? Will this just become another frozen conflict?",25:52,Volker/Morrison
42,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"There are also a vast number of vacancies in key diplomatic positions, so no one was really representing the United States in the negotiating process about ending the war in Eastern Ukraine. During over two years of my tenure as US Special Representative, we fundamentally turned US policy around. US policy towards Ukraine was strong, consistent and enjoyed support across the administration, bipartisan support in Congress and support among our allies and Ukraine. We changed the language commonly used to describe Russia’s aggression.",26:23,Volker/Morrison
43,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I was the administration’s most outspoken public figure highlighting Russia’s invasion and occupation of parts of Ukraine, calling out Russia’s responsibility to end the war. I visited the war zone three times, meeting with soldiers and civilians alike, always bringing media with me to try to raise the public visibility of Russia’s aggression and the humanitarian impact on the lives of the citizens of the Donbass. We coordinated closely with our European allies in Canada to maintain a United front against Russian aggression and for Ukraine’s democracy reform, sovereignty and territorial integrity.",26:57,Volker/Morrison
44,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Ukraine policy is perhaps the one area where the US and its European allies had to be in, in a lockstep. This coordination help to strengthen US sanctions against Russia and to maintain EU sanctions as well. Along with others in the administration, I strongly advocated for lifting the ban on the sale of lethal defensive weapons or at least the defensive arms to Ukraine, advocated for increasing US security assistance to Ukraine and urged other countries to follow suit. My team and I drafted the Pompeo declaration of July 25th, 2018 in which the secretary clearly and definitively laid out the US policy of non-recognition of Russia’s claimed annexation of Crimea.",27:35,Volker/Morrison
45,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I engage with our allies, with Ukraine, and with Russia in negotiations to implement the Minsk agreements, holding a firm line on insisting on the withdrawal of Russian forces dismantling of the so-called people’s republics and restoring Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Together with others in the administration, we kept US policy steady through presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine and worked hard to strengthen the US-Ukraine bilateral relationship under the new president and government, helping shepherd in a peaceful transition of power in Ukraine.",28:20,Volker/Morrison
46,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"So in short, whereas two years ago, most observers would have said that time is on Russia’s side, by 2019 when I departed, we had turned the tables and time was now on Ukraine’s side. It’s a tragedy for the United States and for Ukraine that our efforts in this area, which were bearing fruit, have now been thrown into disarray. One of the critical aspects of my role as US Special Representative was that, as the most senior US official appointed to work solely on the Ukraine portfolio, I needed to step forward to provide leadership. If we needed to adopt a policy position, I made the case for it.",28:51,Volker/Morrison
47,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"If anyone needed to speak out publicly, I would do it. When we failed to get a timely statement about Russia’s illegal attack on Ukraine’s Navy and seizure of Ukraine sailors, I tweeted about it in order to condemn the act. If a problem arose, I knew it was my job to try to fix it. That was my perspective when I learned in May 2019, that we had a significant problem that was impeding our ability to strengthen our support for Ukraine’s new president in his effort to ramp up Ukraine’s fight against corruption and implementation of needed reforms.",29:28,Volker/Morrison
48,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I found myself faced with the choice to be aware of a problem and to ignore it or to accept that it was my responsibility to try to fix it. I tried to fix it. The problem was that despite the unanimous positive assessment and recommendations of those of us who were part of the US presidential delegation that attended the inauguration of President Zelensky, President Trump was receiving a different negative narrative about Ukraine and President Zelensky. That narrative was fueled by accusations from Ukraine’s then prosecutor general and conveyed to the president by former mayor, Rudy Giuliani.",30:04,Volker/Morrison
49,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"As I previously told this committee, I became aware of the negative impact this was having on our policy efforts when four of us, who were a part of the presidential delegation to the inauguration, met as a group with President Trump on May 23rd. We stressed our finding that President Zelensky represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out of the mire of corruption that had been in for over 20 years. We urged him to invite President Zelensky to the White House. The president was very skeptical. Given Ukraine’s history of corruption, that’s understandable.",30:44,Volker/Morrison
50,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"He said that Ukraine was a corrupt country full of terrible people. He said, “They tried to take me down.” In the course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with Mayor Giuliani. It was clear to me that despite the positive news and recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation about the new president, President Trump had a deeply rooted negative view on your grain rooted in the past. He was receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view.",31:19,Volker/Morrison
51,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Within a few days, on May 29th, President Trump indeed signed the congratulatory letter to President Zelensky, which included an invitation to the president to visit him at the White House. However, more than four weeks passed and we could not nail down a date for the meeting. I came to believe that the president’s long-held negative view towards Ukraine was causing hesitation in actually scheduling the meeting much as we had seen in our Oval Office discussion.",31:53,Volker/Morrison
52,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"After weeks of reassuring the Ukrainians that it was just a scheduling issue, I decided to tell President Zelensky that we had a problem with the information reaching President Trump from Mayor Giuliani. I did so in a bilateral meeting at a conference on Ukrainian economic reform in Toronto on July 2nd, 2019 where I led the US delegation. I suggested that he called President Trump directly in order to renew their personal relationship and to assure President Trump that he was committed to investigating and fighting corruption, things on which President Zelensky had based his presidential campaign. I was convinced that getting the two presidents to talk with each other would overcome the negative perception of Ukraine that President Trump still harbored. President Zelensky senior aid, Andriy Yermak, approached me several days later to ask to be connected to Mayor Giuliani. I agreed to make that connection. I did so because I understood that the new Ukrainian leadership wanted to convince those, like Mayor Giuliani, who believed such a negative narrative about Ukraine that times have changed and that, under President Zelensky, Ukraine is worthy of US support.",32:23,Volker/Morrison
53,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Ukrainians believed that if they could get their own narrative across in a way that convinced Mayor Giuliani that they were serious about fighting corruption and advancing reform, Mayor Giuliani would convey that assessment to President Trump thus correcting the previous negative narrative. That made sense to me and I tried to be helpful. I made clear to the Ukrainians that Mayor Giuliani was a private citizen, the president’s personal lawyer and not representing the US government.",33:36,Volker/Morrison
54,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Likewise, in my conversations with Mayor Giuliani, I never considered him to be speaking on the president’s behalf or giving instructions, rather, the information flow was the other way, from Ukraine to Mayor Giuliani in the hopes that this would clear up the information reaching President Trump. On July 10th after hearing from Mr. Yermak, I wrote to Mayor Giuliani to seek to get together and finally on July 19th, we met for breakfast for a longer discussion.",34:05,Volker/Morrison
55,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"At that meeting, I told Mr. Giuliani that in my view, the prosecutor general with whom he had been speaking, Mr. Lutsenko, was not credible and was acting in a self-serving capacity. To my surprise, Mayor Giuliani said that he had already come to that same conclusion. Mr. Giuliani also mentioned both the accusations about Vice President Biden and about interference in the 2016 election and stressed that all he wanted to see was for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past and apply its own laws.",34:32,Volker/Morrison
56,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"… for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past and apply its own laws. Concerning the allegations, I stress that no one in the new team governing Ukraine had anything to do with anything that may have happened in 2016. They were making television shows at the time. I also said that it’s not credible to me that former Vice President Biden would have been influenced in any way by financial or personal motives in carrying out his duties as vice president. A different issue is whether some individual Ukrainians may have attempted to influence the 2016 election or thought they could buy influence. That is at least plausible given Ukraine’s reputation for corruption, but the accusation that Vice President Biden acted inappropriately did not seem at all credible to me. After that meeting, I connected Mayor Giuliani and Mr. Yermak by text and later by phone. They met in person on August 2nd, 2019.",35:03,Volker/Morrison
57,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"In conversations with me following that meeting, which I did not attend, Mr. Giuliani said that he had stressed the importance of Ukraine conducting investigations into what happened in the past and Mr. Yermak stressed that he told Mr. Giuliani it is the government’s program to root out corruption and implement reforms and they would be conducting investigations as part of this process anyway. Mr. Giuliani said he believed the Ukrainian president needed to make a statement about fighting corruption and that he had discussed this with Mr. Yermak. I said, I did not think that this would be a problem since that is the government’s position anyway. I followed up with Mr. Yermak and he said that they would indeed be prepared to make a statement. He said it would reference Burisma and 2016 in a wider context of bilateral relations and rooting out corruption anyway. There was no mention of Vice President Biden. Rather in referencing Burisma and 2016 election interference, it was clear to me that he, Mr. Yermak, was only talking about whether any Ukrainians had acted inappropriately.",35:59,Volker/Morrison
58,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"At this time I was focused on our goal of getting President Zelensky and President Trump to meet with each other and I believe that their doing so would overcome the chronically negative view President Trump had towards Ukraine. I was seeking to solve the problem I saw when we met with President Trump in the Oval Office on May 23rd. As a professional diplomat, I was comfortable exploring whether there was a statement Ukraine could make about its own intentions to investigate possible corruption that would be helpful in convincing Mr. Giuliani to convey to President Trump a more positive assessment of the new leadership in Ukraine. On August 16th, Mr. Yermak shared a draft with me, which I thought looked perfectly reasonable. It did not mention Burisma or 2016 elections but was generic. Ambassador Sondland and I had a further conversation with Mr. Giuliani, who said in his view, in order to be convincing that this government represented real change in Ukraine, the statement should include specific reference to Burisma and 2016. Again, there was no mention of Vice President Biden to these conversations.",37:05,Volker/Morrison
59,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Ambassador Sondland and I discussed these points and I edited the statement drafted by Mr. Yermak to include these points to see how it looked. I then discussed it further with Mr. Yermak. He said that for a number of reasons, including the fact that Mr. Lutsenko was still officially the prosecutor general, they did not want to mention Burisma or 2016. I agreed and the idea of putting out a statement was shelved. These were the last conversations I had about this statement, which were on or about August 17 to 18. My last contact with Mr. Giuliani according to my records was on August 13th, until he tried to reach me on September 20th after the impeachment inquiry was launched. At this time, that is to say in the middle of August, I thought the idea of issuing this statement had been definitively scrapped. In September. I was surprised to learn that there had been further discussions with Ukrainians about President Zelensky possibly making a statement in an interview with U.S. media similar to what we had discussed in August",38:14,Volker/Morrison
60,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Since these events and since I gave my testimony on October 3rd, a great deal of additional information and perspectives have come to light. I’ve learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question. First, at the time I was connecting Mr. Yermak and Mr. Giuliani and discussing with Mr. Yermak and Ambassador Sondland a possible statement that could be made by the Ukrainian president, I did not know of any linkage between the hold on security assistance and Ukraine pursuing investigations. No one had ever said that to me and I never conveyed such a linkage to the Ukrainians. I oppose the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18th and I thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it. I did not know the reason for the hold, but I viewed it as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally and I was confident we would do so.",39:19,Volker/Morrison
61,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I believe the Ukrainians became aware of the hold on August 29th and not before. That date is the first time any of them asked me about the hold by forwarding an article that had been published in Politico. When I spoke to the Ukrainians about the hold after August 29th, instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite, that they should not be alarmed, it was an internal U.S. problem and we were working to get it fixed. I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around the same time. Second, I did not know about the strong concerns expressed by then national Security Advisor, John Bolton to members of his NSC staff regarding the discussion of investigations. I participated in the July 10th meeting between National Security Advisor Bolton and then Ukrainian chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, Alex Danylyuk.",40:14,Volker/Morrison
62,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"As I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about investigations. I think all of us thought it was inappropriate. The conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded. Later on in the Ward Room. I may have been engaged in a side conversation or had already left the complex because I do not recall further discussion regarding investigations or Burisma. Third, I did not understand that others believe that any investigation of Ukrainian company, Burisma, which had a history of accusations of corruption was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden. I drew a sharp distinction between the two. It has long been U.S. policy under multiple administrations to urge Ukraine to investigate and fight internal corruption. I was quite comfortable with Ukraine making its own statement about its own policy of investigating and fighting corruption at home. At the one in person meeting I had with Mayor Giuliani on July 19th, Mayor Giuliani raised and I rejected the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.",41:07,Volker/Morrison
63,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"As I previously testified, I have known Vice President Biden for 24 years, he is an honorable man and I hold him in the highest regard. At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden. And as you know from the extensive documentation I provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of discussion. I was not on the July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25th, 2019. Throughout this time, I understood that there was an important distinction between Burisma and Biden and I urge the Ukrainians to maintain such a distinction. I did not know that President Trump or others had raised Vice President Biden with Ukrainians or had conflated the investigation of possible Ukrainian corruption with investigation of the former vice president.",42:14,Volker/Morrison
64,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"In retrospect, for the Ukrainians, it would clearly have been confusing. In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company, Burisma, as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different, the former being appropriate and unremarkable. The latter being unacceptable. In retrospect, I should’ve seen that connection differently and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections. Fourth, much has been made of the term, “three amigos” in reference to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland and myself. I’ve never used that term and frankly cringe when I hear it because for me, the “three amigos” will always refer to Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman and Senator Graham in reference to their work to support the surge in Iraq. Moreover, I was never aware of any designation by President Trump or anyone else putting Ambassador Sondland or the three of us as a group in charge of Ukraine policy.",43:06,Volker/Morrison
65,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Rather, as I understood it, each of us in our own respective official capacities continued to work together after our attendance of President Zelensky’s inauguration to push for greater U.S. support for Ukraine. Leading the diplomacy around Ukraine negotiations have long been my official responsibility, but I welcomed the added support and influence of a cabinet member and our EU ambassador. Fifth, I was not aware that Ambassador Sondland spoke with President Trump on July 26th, while Ambassador Taylor and I were visiting the conflict zone. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, allow me to thank you again for the opportunity to provide this testimony. I believe that U.S. foreign policy and national security interest in Ukraine are of critical importance and I’d be pleased to answer your questions. Thank you.",44:03,Volker/Morrison
66,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Thank you gentlemen for your opening statements, we’ll now proceed to the first round of questions. As detailed in the memo provided to the committee members, there’ll be 45 minutes of questions conducted by the chairman or majority counsel followed by 45 minutes for the ranking member or minority counsel. Following that, unless I specify additional equal time for extended questioning, we’ll proceed under the five minute rule and every member will have a chance to ask questions. I now recognize myself or counsel for the first round of questions.",44:50,Volker/Morrison
67,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador Volker, I was going to just yield to the minority counsel, but there are a couple points that you made in your opening statement that I wanted to ask about first. First you said that now, former Attorney General Lutsenko was not credible. Mr. Lutsenko is the author of a number of allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch, a number of allegations that were shared with John Solomon of The Hill, a number of allegations that have been repeatedly brought up by my Republican colleagues. Why is it that you found Mr. Lutsenko not credible and told Mr. Giuliani?",45:23,Volker/Morrison
68,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First off, the allegations themselves, including those against Ambassador Yovanovitch did not appear to me to be credible at all. I know her to be an incredibly competent professional. Someone I’ve worked with for many, many years. The suggestions that she was acting in some inappropriate manner were not credible to me. I’ve known Vice President Biden for a long time. Those accusations were not credible. And then separate from that, I also was aware of the political situation in Ukraine. We had a situation where President Poroshenko appeared to not be in a favorable position going into the elections. Where it was increasingly apparent then candidate Zelensky was going to win. As is often the case in Ukraine, a change in power would mean change in prosecutorial powers as well. And there have been efforts in the past at prosecuting the previous government.",46:06,Volker/Morrison
69,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I think Mr. Lutsenko in my estimation, and I said this to Mayor Giuliani when I met with him, was interested in preserving his own position. He wanted to avoid being fired by a new government in order to prevent prosecution of himself, possible prosecution of himself. Possibly also this is something that President Poroshenko would’ve welcomed as well because he probably would have avoided any efforts to prosecute President Poroshenko as well. So by making allegations like this and making sure they were reaching U.S. media, I think that Mr. Lutsenko was trying to make himself appear to be an important and influential player in the United States.",47:05,Volker/Morrison
70,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador, let me also ask you about the allegations against Joe Biden because that has been a continuing refrain from some of my colleagues as well. Why was it you found the allegations against Joe Biden related to his son or Burisma not to be believed?",47:45,Volker/Morrison
71,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Simply because I’ve known Vice President, former Vice President Biden for a long time. I know how he respects his duties of higher office and it’s just not credible to me that a Vice President of the United States is going to do anything other than act as how he sees best for the national interest.",48:01,Volker/Morrison
72,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"And finally, Ambassador, before I turn it over, I was struck by something you said on page eight of your statement, which reads, “In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company, Burisma as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as different, the former being appropriate and unremarkable. The latter being unacceptable. In retrospect,” you said, “I should have seen that connection differently and had I done so I would have raised my own objections.” What is it now, Ambassador, in retrospect, that you recognize that you didn’t at this time that leads you to conclude that you would or should have raised these objections?",48:21,Volker/Morrison
73,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yeah. That others did not see the distinction between these things as I saw it. As I said, there is a history of corruption in Ukraine. There’s a history with the company of Burisma that’s been investigated. That is well known. There is a separate allegation about the vice president acting inappropriately. His son was a board member of this company, but those things I saw as completely distinct .and what I was trying to do in working with Ukrainians was to thread a needle to see whether things that they can do that are appropriate and reasonable as part of Ukraine’s own policy of fighting corruption. That helped clarify for our President that are committed to that very effort. If there’s a way to thread that needle, I thought it was worth the effort to try to solve that problem. As it turns out, I now understand that most of the other people didn’t see or didn’t consider this distinction, that for them it was synonymous.",49:07,Volker/Morrison
74,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Well, one of those people who sought synonymous turns out to be the President of the United States. I take it you didn’t know until the call record was released that the President in that call doesn’t raise Burisma, He asked for an investigation of the Bidens, is that right?",50:11,Volker/Morrison
75,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,50:26,Volker/Morrison
76,Section_0,Adam Schiff,I take it since you say that you acknowledge that asking for an investigation of the Bidens would have been unacceptable and objectionable. That had the President asked you to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens you would have told him so.,50:29,Volker/Morrison
77,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I would’ve objected to that, yes sir.",50:45,Volker/Morrison
78,Section_0,Adam Schiff,Mr. Goldman.,50:48,Volker/Morrison
79,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just one follow up on that Ambassador Volker, when when you say, thread the needle, you mean that you understood the relationship between Vice President Biden’s son and Burisma, but you were trying to separate the two of them in your mind, is that right?",50:49,Volker/Morrison
80,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Well I believe that they were separate. And this references the conversation I had with Mr. Giuliani as well, where I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible. Separate question is whether it is appropriate for Ukraine to investigate possible corruption of Ukrainians that may have tried to corrupt things or buy influence. To me they are very different things and as I said, I think the former is unacceptable, I think the latter in this case [crosstalk 00:51:39]",51:08,Volker/Morrison
81,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Understood. But you understood the relationship between Hunter Biden and Burisma-,51:38,Volker/Morrison
82,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I knew that he had been a board member of the company, yes.",51:42,Volker/Morrison
83,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Let’s go back.,51:45,Volker/Morrison
84,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That’s why it was so important to maintain a distinction.,51:46,Volker/Morrison
85,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Let’s focus on the the July 25th call for a moment. And Mr. Morrison, July 25th was day number what for you as the senior director overseeing Ukraine?",51:49,Volker/Morrison
86,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I officially took over on the 15th, approximately 10 days, very few days actually in the office.",52:04,Volker/Morrison
87,Section_0,Dan Goldman,You testified in your deposition that you received an email on the morning of July 25th from Ambassador’s Sondland shortly before the call. Is that right?,52:11,Volker/Morrison
88,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,52:21,Volker/Morrison
89,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And I believe in that email Ambassador Sondland told you that he had briefed President Trump in advance of the call, is that right?",52:22,Volker/Morrison
90,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,52:30,Volker/Morrison
91,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"You also testified that Ambassador Sondland had told you on another occasion that he could call the President whenever he wanted, is that right?",52:33,Volker/Morrison
92,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,52:43,Volker/Morrison
93,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And on July 25th, did you in fact make an effort to confirm whether or not the phone call between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump actually occurred?",52:44,Volker/Morrison
94,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I did.,52:55,Volker/Morrison
95,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And did it happen?,52:56,Volker/Morrison
96,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,52:58,Volker/Morrison
97,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"On other occasions when Ambassador Sondland told you that he spoke with President Trump, on some other occasions did you also seek confirmation of that fact?",53:00,Volker/Morrison
98,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"On some, yes.",53:09,Volker/Morrison
99,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And on those occasions when you did seek to confirm that they had spoken, what did you find?",53:10,Volker/Morrison
100,Section_0,Tim Morrison,They had.,53:17,Volker/Morrison
101,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now, I’m going to pull up a text message on the morning of July 25th, between, well, it should be another one. Oh yeah, sorry. Ambassador Sondland with you, Ambassador Volker. And at 7:54 in the morning, Ambassador Sondland says, “Call ASAP.” Then at 9:35 AM, Ambassador Volker, you respond, is the screen working in front of you or just to the side?",53:18,Volker/Morrison
102,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yeah.,53:51,Volker/Morrison
103,Section_0,Dan Goldman,So if you could go ahead and read what you said.,53:51,Volker/Morrison
104,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes.,53:54,Volker/Morrison
105,Section_0,Dan Goldman,At 9:35 AM.,53:55,Volker/Morrison
106,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes. So I say, “Hi Gordon. Got your message. Had a great lunch with Yermak and then passed your message to him. He will see you tomorrow. Think everything is in place.”",53:57,Volker/Morrison
107,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And who is Yermak?,54:09,Volker/Morrison
108,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Andre Yermak is the senior advisor to President Zelensky of Ukraine.,54:11,Volker/Morrison
109,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now, what was the message that you had received?",54:19,Volker/Morrison
110,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"That President Zelensky should be clear, convincing, forthright with President Trump about his commitment to fighting corruption, investigating what happened in the past, get to the bottom of things, whatever there is. And if he does that, President Trump was prepared to be reassured that he would say, “Yes, come on, let’s get this date for this visit scheduled.”",54:24,Volker/Morrison
111,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And did you understand from that message that Ambassador Sondland had spoken to President Trump?,54:51,Volker/Morrison
112,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I wasn’t sure whether he had or not. He, as Mr. Morrison just said, said that he does speak with President Trump. I knew that he had conversations in general. I didn’t know specifically about one leading up to this.",54:55,Volker/Morrison
113,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Now on the screen in front of you is another text message from you that same morning-,55:09,Volker/Morrison
114,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes.,55:14,Volker/Morrison
115,Section_0,Dan Goldman,At 8:36 in the morning to Andre Yermak.,55:14,Volker/Morrison
116,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I believe because of the time difference. This is actually in the afternoon in Ukraine.",55:18,Volker/Morrison
117,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"In Ukraine, and so this is East coast time, that’s right. So this is slightly less than a half hour before the call between President Trump and President Zelensky.",55:23,Volker/Morrison
118,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Right-,55:31,Volker/Morrison
119,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And can you just read what you wrote there?,55:31,Volker/Morrison
120,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes. And just after the lunch that I had with Andre Yermak. Says, “Good lunch, thanks. Heard from White House, assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck. See you tomorrow, Kurt.",55:33,Volker/Morrison
121,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And does this accurately relay the message that you had received from Ambassador Sondland?,55:49,Volker/Morrison
122,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes.,55:54,Volker/Morrison
123,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now Mr. Morrison, did the National Security Council also prepare talking points for President Trump for this call?",55:56,Volker/Morrison
124,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"The NSC staff did, yes.",56:03,Volker/Morrison
125,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And per usual custom, were these talking points based on the official United States policy objectives?",56:05,Volker/Morrison
126,Section_0,Tim Morrison,They were.,56:14,Volker/Morrison
127,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And since there has been a little bit of dispute about what that means, can you explain how official U.S. policy is determined through the inter-agency process?",56:16,Volker/Morrison
128,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"We operate under what’s known as NSPM-4, National Security Presidential Memorandum-4 it’s available on the internet. That lays out how the President wants to be provided options for his decision.",56:27,Volker/Morrison
129,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And there’s an extensive process to finalize any policy, is that right?",56:40,Volker/Morrison
130,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Sometimes.,56:48,Volker/Morrison
131,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Mr. Morrison, you listened to this call on the 25th, is that right?",56:53,Volker/Morrison
132,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I did.,56:57,Volker/Morrison
133,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Where did you listen from?,56:57,Volker/Morrison
134,Section_0,Tim Morrison,The White House Situation Room.,56:58,Volker/Morrison
135,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"In your deposition, you testified that the call was not what you were hoping to hear. What did you mean by that?",57:00,Volker/Morrison
136,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I was hoping for a more full-throated statement of support from the President concerning President Zelensky’s reform agenda. Given where we were at the time with respect to the overwhelming mandate, President Zelensky Servant of the Party people had received in the Rada election.",57:07,Volker/Morrison
137,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And Rada, which is the Ukrainian parliament, that election had occurred four days earlier?",57:28,Volker/Morrison
138,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Sounds right.,57:32,Volker/Morrison
139,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And President Zelensky’s party won in a landslide, is that right?",57:33,Volker/Morrison
140,Section_0,Tim Morrison,They received more than a majority in their own right.,57:37,Volker/Morrison
141,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"So at least in Ukraine there was tremendous support for Zelensky’s anti-corruption agenda, is that right?",57:41,Volker/Morrison
142,Section_0,Tim Morrison,At the time.,57:48,Volker/Morrison
143,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And within the inner agency, within the national security agencies here in the United States, was there broad support for President Zelensky?",57:50,Volker/Morrison
144,Section_0,Tim Morrison,There was broad support for giving President Zelensky a chance.,58:02,Volker/Morrison
145,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And to that point he had shown that he had at least put his money where his mouth was for the three months that he had been in office, is that right?",58:06,Volker/Morrison
146,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Approximately three months, yes.",58:15,Volker/Morrison
147,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now I’m going to show a couple of excerpts from this call record to each of you. The first is President Trump responding to a comment by President Zelensky related to defense support from the United States and the purchase of javelins. And President Trump then says, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine they say Crowdstrike .. I guess you have one of your wealthy people … the server, they say Ukraine has it.” And if we could go to the next excerpt, where President Trump says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden’s stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.”",58:17,Volker/Morrison
148,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now, Mr. Morrison were these references to Crowdstrike, the server, 2016 election and to Vice President Biden and his son, were they included in the President’s talking points?",59:16,Volker/Morrison
149,Section_0,Tim Morrison,They were not.,59:29,Volker/Morrison
150,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And were they consistent with what you understood at that time to be official U.S. policy?,59:31,Volker/Morrison
151,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I was not aware of much of this at the time.,59:37,Volker/Morrison
152,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, subsequent to this call, you did nothing to implement the investigations that President Trump … implement the request for the investigations that President Trump asked for, is that right?",59:40,Volker/Morrison
153,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I did not understand any instruction to do so.,59:53,Volker/Morrison
154,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And you were not aware of anyone else within … you coordinate the inter-agency process and you were not aware of anyone else who was doing that either, is that right?",59:55,Volker/Morrison
155,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct.,01:00:04,Volker/Morrison
156,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now, you testified in your deposition that hearing this call confirmed what you called the parallel process that your predecessor, Fiona Hill, had warned you about. What did you mean by that?",01:00:06,Volker/Morrison
157,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"During the period in which Dr. Hill and I were conducting handoff meetings so that I could be up to speed on the various things that were occurring in the portfolio at the time. She mentioned the traditional NSPM-4 process and the parallel process. And in the context of discussing the parallel process, she mentioned issues like Burisma, which were noteworthy to me at the time because I had never heard of them before. And upon hearing them in the call, it wound up confirming, okay, there there’s something here.",01:00:21,Volker/Morrison
158,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And who did she inform you was involved in this parallel process?,01:01:02,Volker/Morrison
159,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"As I recall, it was definitely Ambassador Sondland and I believe Mr. Giuliani.",01:01:05,Volker/Morrison
160,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And after she informed you of this company, Burisma, what if anything did you do to determine what that was?",01:01:11,Volker/Morrison
161,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"After that particular a handoff meeting, I proceeded to look it up on the internet. I Googled it.",01:01:19,Volker/Morrison
162,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And did you find that it had some association with Hunter Biden?,01:01:25,Volker/Morrison
163,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:01:28,Volker/Morrison
164,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now Ambassador Volker, you did not listen to this call but you testified that you were surprised and troubled when you read the call record after it was released on September 25th. And you also that after reading the call record, it was clear to you that the Biden, Burisma and the 2016 election investigations that President Trump discussed on the call were designed to serve the President’s political interests, not the national interest. What did you mean when you said that?",01:01:30,Volker/Morrison
165,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Sir, I don’t recall that language from my testimony, it’s from my October 3rd testimony?",01:02:05,Volker/Morrison
166,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Yes it was.,01:02:09,Volker/Morrison
167,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Thank you. Well, what I do mean by that, and I’d like to phrase it in my own words now, is I don’t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things that I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former prosecutor general, are sort of, they’re not things that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine. We should be supporting Ukraine’s democracy, reforms, its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing and I don’t think pursuing these things serves a national interest.",01:02:10,Volker/Morrison
168,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now, Mr. Morrison, shortly after you heard the July 25th call, you testified that you alerted the NSC legal advisor, John Eisenberg, pretty much right away, is that right?",01:03:03,Volker/Morrison
169,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct.,01:03:16,Volker/Morrison
170,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And you indicated in your opening statement, or at least from your deposition that you went to Mr. Eisenberg out of concern over the potential political fallout if the call record became public and not because he thought it was illegal, is that right?",01:03:17,Volker/Morrison
171,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct.,01:03:32,Volker/Morrison
172,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"But you you would agree, right, that asking a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival is inappropriate, would you not?",01:03:34,Volker/Morrison
173,Section_0,Tim Morrison,It’s not what we recommended that the President discuss.,01:03:44,Volker/Morrison
174,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now in a second meeting with Mr. Eisenberg, what did you recommend that he do to prevent the call record from leaking?",01:03:48,Volker/Morrison
175,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I recommended we restrict access to the package.,01:03:58,Volker/Morrison
176,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Had you ever asked the NSC legal advisor to restrict access before?,01:04:01,Volker/Morrison
177,Section_0,Tim Morrison,No.,01:04:04,Volker/Morrison
178,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Did you speak to your supervisor, Dr. Kupperman, before you went to speak to John Eisenberg?",01:04:06,Volker/Morrison
179,Section_0,Tim Morrison,No.,01:04:11,Volker/Morrison
180,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Did you subsequently learn that the call record had been put in a highly classified system?,01:04:13,Volker/Morrison
181,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I did.,01:04:17,Volker/Morrison
182,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And what reason did Mr. Eisenberg give you for why the call record was put in the highly classified system?,01:04:19,Volker/Morrison
183,Section_0,Tim Morrison,It was a mistake.,01:04:24,Volker/Morrison
184,Section_0,Dan Goldman,He said it was just a mistake?,01:04:26,Volker/Morrison
185,Section_0,Tim Morrison,It was an administrative error.,01:04:29,Volker/Morrison
186,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now isn’t it also true though, that you had authority to restrict access on the regular system if you wanted to?",01:04:33,Volker/Morrison
187,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I believe I could have instructed the appropriate staff to do so, yes.",01:04:40,Volker/Morrison
188,Section_0,Dan Goldman,So why did you go to the NSC legal advisor to recommend that?,01:04:43,Volker/Morrison
189,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Well, I was also concerned that based on the participants in the listening room that day, I did not then, and I do not now recall any representatives from the NSC legal advisor’s office, as they were often on head of state calls, but not always. And I wanted to make sure that John Eisenberg as the legal advisor and his deputy were aware to review this particular transcript.",01:04:47,Volker/Morrison
190,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And you wanted them to review it because you were concerned about the potential political consequences, not because anything was wrong?",01:05:13,Volker/Morrison
191,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct and political consequences was an umbrella term I used in my statement to describe a series of effects I feared about what would happen if and when the content of the transcript or the content of the [inaudible 01:05:34] leaked.,01:05:21,Volker/Morrison
192,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"So just to make sure I understand this correctly, Mr. Morrison, you heard the call, you recognize that President Trump was not discussing the talking points that the NSC had prepared based on official U.S. policy and was instead talking about the investigations that Fiona Hill had warned you about, and then you reported it immediately to the NSC legal advisor. Is that the correct chain of events here?",01:05:34,Volker/Morrison
193,Section_0,Tim Morrison,That’s correct.,01:06:02,Volker/Morrison
194,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now, Ambassador Volker in the July 25th call, President Zelensky volunteers to President Trump that Rudy Giuliani had already spoken with one of his associates and that President Zelensky hopes Giuliani will come to Ukraine. And in response, President Trump proceeds to mention Mr. Giuliani on three separate occasions during this call. You testified about a May 23rd meeting in the Oval Office where the President spoke quite negatively about Ukraine and how it tried to take him down. And that he also repeated some of the allegations that Mr. Giuliani was making, is that correct?",01:06:04,Volker/Morrison
195,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:06:45,Volker/Morrison
196,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Okay. And those allegations were in the media, were they not?",01:06:46,Volker/Morrison
197,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:06:49,Volker/Morrison
198,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And during that meeting, President Trump told you and Ambassador Sondland and Secretary Perry to talk to Giuliani, isn’t that correct?",01:06:50,Volker/Morrison
199,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I didn’t take it as an instruction, I want to be clear about that. He said, “That’s not what I hear.” When we were giving him our assessment about President Zelensky and where Ukraine is headed, “That’s not what I hear. I are terrible things. He’s got terrible people around him, talk to Rudy.” And I understood in that context, him just saying, that’s where he hears it from. I didn’t take it as an instruction.",01:07:02,Volker/Morrison
200,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"So when he said, “talk to Rudy,” you didn’t take it for him to mean for you to talk to Rudy?",01:07:25,Volker/Morrison
201,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"No, I didn’t take it that way. I took it as, just part of the dialogue that “I hear other things, I hear them from Rudy Giuliani or other people. That’s not what’s going on. He’s surrounded by terrible people. Talk to Rudy.” It just seemed like part of the dialogue.",01:07:31,Volker/Morrison
202,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Well, after that meeting, did you in fact talk to Rudy?",01:07:50,Volker/Morrison
203,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"After that meeting not immediately, no. Remember this was May 23rd and we continued to proceed with our effort to get the White House visit for President Zelensky scheduled and to keep ramping up our support for the new Ukrainian president, and ultimately the new Ukrainian government. I did, however, on July 2nd as I was becoming concerned that we were not succeeding at this, to tell President Zelensky, “I think we have a problem.” And that problem being this negative feed of information from Mr. Giuliani.",01:07:53,Volker/Morrison
204,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Ultimately, I think as you testified in your opening statement, you introduced Mr. Yermak to Mr. Giuliani and they eventually met, is that right?",01:08:27,Volker/Morrison
205,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:08:35,Volker/Morrison
206,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now, during this whole time in July and after the call into early August when they met, Ukraine still desperately wanted that Oval Office meeting for President Zelensky, correct?",01:08:36,Volker/Morrison
207,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:08:46,Volker/Morrison
208,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And you also wanted that for President Zelensky, is that right?",01:08:46,Volker/Morrison
209,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:08:50,Volker/Morrison
210,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Why was that Oval Office meeting so important to President Zelensky?,01:08:50,Volker/Morrison
211,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I think that he felt that he was not well understood by President Trump. He is a charismatic leader who ran a remarkable campaign in Ukraine against the legacy of corruption and political mullahs that had been there. He had a massive showing in the presidential election, 73% support. He believed he was leading a movement of major change in Ukraine, and that President Trump did not see that or didn’t appreciate that. But if he had a chance to sit down and speak with President Trump face to face, he believed that he could be very convincing about that and I agree with him.",01:08:54,Volker/Morrison
212,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"That certainly was your assessment, right?",01:09:31,Volker/Morrison
213,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"It was my assessment, and I believe it was also what President Zelensky believed.",01:09:33,Volker/Morrison
214,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And certainly you understood from your experience in Ukraine that there would be a significant boost in legitimacy at home for President Zelensky if there were photos of him in the Oval Office, et cetera, right?",01:09:37,Volker/Morrison
215,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, that is correct.",01:09:48,Volker/Morrison
216,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now, you testified in your opening statement that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak, Zelensky’s aid met on August 2nd. Where did they meet?",01:09:49,Volker/Morrison
217,Section_0,Kurt Volker,They met in Madrid.,01:09:59,Volker/Morrison
218,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And did you learn that Mr. Giuliani-,01:10:01,Volker/Morrison
219,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Madrid.,01:10:03,Volker/Morrison
220,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And what did you learn that Mr. Giuliani requested anything of the Ukrainians at that meeting?,01:10:03,Volker/Morrison
221,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Only when I spoke with Mr. Giuliani afterwards, he said that he thought Ukraine should issue a statement. And then I spoke with Mr. Yermak after that, and he said yes and we are prepared to make a statement. And that then kicked off the series of discussions that I said in my testimony.",01:10:08,Volker/Morrison
222,Section_0,Dan Goldman,We’ll get into that in a second. But Mr. Giuliani did not explain to you what needed to be included in that statement and that call you had?,01:10:25,Volker/Morrison
223,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"He said something more general, as I recall. I recall him saying fight corruption, that their commitment to being different. Mr. Yermak told me when I spoke with him, as I recall, that the statement would include specific mention of Burisma and 2016.",01:10:33,Volker/Morrison
224,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Right. Let’s go through some of the text messages so we know exactly who said what. And first, let’s start on August 9th. This is a text exchange between you and Ambassador Sondland, where Ambassador Sondland writes at the top, “Morrison ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms.” And what did you respond?",01:10:51,Volker/Morrison
225,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I said excellent with two exclamation points. How did you sway him with a smile afterwards?,01:11:13,Volker/Morrison
226,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Ambassador Sondland responded, “Not sure I did. I think POTUS really wants the deliverable.” And what did you say to that?",01:11:19,Volker/Morrison
227,Section_0,Kurt Volker,But how does he know that?,01:11:26,Volker/Morrison
228,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And Ambassador Sondland says, “Yep, clearly lots of convos going on.” Now, Mr. Morrison, you’re referenced in this text message. Had you discussed confirming a date for a White House visit for President Zelensky with Ambassador Sondland around this time?",01:11:28,Volker/Morrison
229,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I likely would have.,01:11:44,Volker/Morrison
230,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And did you have any discussions with him about a statement that Ukraine, that they were trying to get Ukraine to make?",01:11:47,Volker/Morrison
231,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I did not.,01:11:58,Volker/Morrison
232,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Were you aware that… Do you yourself know what Ambassador Sondland meant by the deliverable?,01:12:00,Volker/Morrison
233,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I did not at the time. I think I have an understanding now.,01:12:09,Volker/Morrison
234,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And what is your understanding now?,01:12:14,Volker/Morrison
235,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"There seems to have been discussions about a statement, various drafts of which have been discussed in various proceedings.",01:12:16,Volker/Morrison
236,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"But this to your knowledge, was part of that parallel process you were talking about?",01:12:24,Volker/Morrison
237,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:12:28,Volker/Morrison
238,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"If we can now go to the next exhibit, which is another text exchange just a few minutes later between Ambassador Sondland and you Ambassador Volker, where Ambassador Sondland says, “To avoid misunderstandings, might be helpful to ask Andrey for a draft statement embargoed so that we can see exactly what they propose to cover. Even though Ze, Zelensky, does a live presser, they can still summarize in a brief statement. Thoughts?” And how did you respond?",01:12:29,Volker/Morrison
239,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Agree.,01:13:00,Volker/Morrison
240,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And this relates to the statement that Mr. Giuliani wanted. Is that right, Ambassador Volker?",01:13:01,Volker/Morrison
241,Section_0,Kurt Volker,It relates to the statement that he and Mr. Yermak had discussed.,01:13:06,Volker/Morrison
242,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And now to the next day on August 10th, there’s another text exchange between you and Mr. Yermak, who’s the same aid that Mr. Giuliani had met in Madrid. And if you could read what you wrote at the top at 5:02 PM.",01:13:09,Volker/Morrison
243,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Right. I wrote, I agree with your approach. Let’s iron out statement and use that to get date and then President Zelensky can go forward with it.",01:13:26,Volker/Morrison
244,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And Mr. Yermak responds, “Once we have a date, we will call for a press briefing announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US Ukraine relationship, including among other things, Burisma and election meddling in investigations.” And what did you respond?",01:13:36,Volker/Morrison
245,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Sounds great.,01:13:57,Volker/Morrison
246,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now the date that he’s referring to, that is the date for the White House visit.",01:13:59,Volker/Morrison
247,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:14:03,Volker/Morrison
248,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now two days later on August 12th, you receive another text message from Mr. Yermak, which reads, “Special attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States, especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians. I want to declare that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.” Now Ambassador Volker, this was a draft, was it not of the statement that you and Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak and Ambassador Sondland had been discussing?",01:14:05,Volker/Morrison
249,Section_0,Kurt Volker,This is the first draft of that from Mr. Yermak after the conversations that we had.,01:14:51,Volker/Morrison
250,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And it does not mention Burisma or the 2016 election interference, correct?",01:14:57,Volker/Morrison
251,Section_0,Kurt Volker,It does not.,01:15:00,Volker/Morrison
252,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And you testified in your deposition that you and Ambassador Sondland and Mayor Giuliani had a conversation about this draft after you received it. Is that right?,01:15:01,Volker/Morrison
253,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:15:11,Volker/Morrison
254,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And Mr. Giuliani said that if the statement did not include Burisma and 2016 election, it would not have any credibility. Is that right?",01:15:14,Volker/Morrison
255,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:15:23,Volker/Morrison
256,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now, this was the same Rudy Giuliani that President Trump was discussing in that May 23rd meeting and asked you and the others to talk to, correct?",01:15:24,Volker/Morrison
257,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is the same Mr. Giuliani.,01:15:37,Volker/Morrison
258,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And even at that point on May 23rd, you were aware of these investigations that he was publicly promoting. Correct?",01:15:38,Volker/Morrison
259,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I knew that he had adopted or was interested in all of those conspiracy theories that had come from Lutsenko.,01:15:46,Volker/Morrison
260,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Back in May, you knew that?",01:15:54,Volker/Morrison
261,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Back in May.,01:15:55,Volker/Morrison
262,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Now he was insisting on a public commitment from President Zelensky to do these investigations. Correct?,01:15:56,Volker/Morrison
263,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Well, now what do we mean by these investigations?",01:16:04,Volker/Morrison
264,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Oh, Burisma and the 2016 election.",01:16:07,Volker/Morrison
265,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Burisma and 2016, yes.",01:16:09,Volker/Morrison
266,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And at the time that you were engaged in coordinating for this statement, did you find it unusual that there was such an emphasis on a public statement from President Zelensky to carry out the investigations that the president was seeking?",01:16:12,Volker/Morrison
267,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I didn’t find it that unusual. I think when you’re dealing with a situation where I believe the president was highly skeptical about President Zelensky being committed to really changing Ukraine after his entirely negative view of the country, that he would want to hear something more from President Zelensky to be convinced that, okay, I’ll give this guy a chance.",01:16:27,Volker/Morrison
268,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And perhaps he also wanted a public statement because it would lock President Zelensky in to do these investigations that he thought might benefit him?,01:16:49,Volker/Morrison
269,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Well, again, when we say these investigations, what I understood us to be talking about was Ukrainian corruption.",01:16:59,Volker/Morrison
270,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Well, what we’re talking about is Burisma and the 2016 election. Let’s just, we can agree on that. And so when we’re talking about these investigations, isn’t it clear that a public statement would be important to Mr. Giuliani because it was politically useful to the president?",01:17:07,Volker/Morrison
271,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"The way I saw it is that it would be helpful. It would be a way of being convincing to Mayor Giuliani and also the president that this team in Ukraine is serious about fighting corruption reform, that they are different. And if that would be helpful in getting a more positive attitude and the White House meeting scheduled, then that would be useful.",01:17:23,Volker/Morrison
272,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And that would be helpful to get that White House meeting?,01:17:45,Volker/Morrison
273,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Correct.,01:17:47,Volker/Morrison
274,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"In fact, it was a necessary condition as you understood at that point.",01:17:48,Volker/Morrison
275,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I wouldn’t have called it a necessary condition. And in fact, when it became clear later that we were not able to agree on an agreement that the Ukrainians were comfortable with, I agree with the Ukrainians just to drop it. It’s not worth it.",01:17:51,Volker/Morrison
276,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"No, I understand that. But is it your testimony that based on the texts that you wrote linking the investigations and the 2016 election on July 25th to the White House meeting, you’re saying that by this point in August with this back and forth that you were unaware that this public statement was a condition for the White House meeting?",01:18:04,Volker/Morrison
277,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I wouldn’t have called it a condition. It’s a nuance I guess, but I viewed it as very helpful. If we could get this done, it would help improve the perception that President Trump and others had, and then we would get the date for a meeting. If we didn’t have a statement, I wasn’t giving up and thinking that, oh well then we’ll never get a meeting.",01:18:23,Volker/Morrison
278,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Let’s go to the next day where there was another text exchange. And at the top could you just read the first text there?,01:18:44,Volker/Morrison
279,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"It says, “Hi Andrey. Good talking. Following is text with insert at the end for the two key items. We will work on official request.”",01:18:52,Volker/Morrison
280,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And then you’ll see the highlighted portion of the next text. The other is identical to your previous one and then it just adds including the… Including these involving Burisma and the 2016 elections. Is that right?,01:19:00,Volker/Morrison
281,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:19:11,Volker/Morrison
282,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And that was what Mr. Giuliani insisted on adding to the statement?,01:19:12,Volker/Morrison
283,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That’s what he said will be necessary for that to be credible.,01:19:16,Volker/Morrison
284,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And the Ukrainians ultimately did not issue this statement. Is that right?,01:19:19,Volker/Morrison
285,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:19:23,Volker/Morrison
286,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And President Zelensky ultimately did not get the oval office meeting either, did he?",01:19:24,Volker/Morrison
287,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Not yet.,01:19:27,Volker/Morrison
288,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now I want to move forward to September, in early September, when the security assistance begins to more overtly be used as leverage to pressure the Ukrainians to conduct these investigations that President Trump wanted. Mr. Morrison, you accompanied Vice President Pence to Warsaw when he met with President Zelensky. Is that right?",01:19:30,Volker/Morrison
289,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I was in Warsaw when the vice president was designated as the president’s representative. I was accompanying Ambassador Bolton.,01:19:58,Volker/Morrison
290,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Understood. You were at the bilateral meeting with the vice president and president Zelensky. Correct?,01:20:06,Volker/Morrison
291,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I was.,01:20:11,Volker/Morrison
292,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And in that meeting, were the Ukrainians concerned about the hold on security clearance, military assistance rather?",01:20:11,Volker/Morrison
293,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:20:24,Volker/Morrison
294,Section_0,Dan Goldman,What did they say?,01:20:26,Volker/Morrison
295,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"It was the first issue that President Zelensky raised with Vice President Pence. They were very interested. They talked about its importance to Ukraine, its important to the relationship.",01:20:29,Volker/Morrison
296,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And what was Vice President Pence’s response?,01:20:43,Volker/Morrison
297,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"The vice president represented that it was a priority for him and that we were working to address, and he characterized President Trump’s concerns about the state of corruption in Ukraine and the president’s prioritization of getting the Europeans to contribute more to security sector assistance.",01:20:46,Volker/Morrison
298,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And did he directly explain to the Ukrainians that those were the actual reasons for the holds, or was he just commenting on general concerns of the president?",01:21:14,Volker/Morrison
299,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I don’t know that he necessarily acknowledged a hold. He mentioned that we were reviewing the assistance, and that’s the way I heard it. That’s the way I would characterize it. And those were the points he raised to help President Zelensky understand where we were in our process.",01:21:26,Volker/Morrison
300,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And to your knowledge though on sort of the staff level as the coordinator of all the inter-agency process, you were not of any review of the Ukraine security assistance money, were you?",01:21:46,Volker/Morrison
301,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Well we were. We had been running a review. We had been running an inter-agency process to provide the president the information that I had been directed to generate for the president’s consideration as to the state of inter-agency support for continuing Ukraine security sector assistance.,01:22:00,Volker/Morrison
302,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And the entire inter-agency supported the continuation of the security assistance, isn’t that right?",01:22:18,Volker/Morrison
303,Section_0,Tim Morrison,That is correct.,01:22:23,Volker/Morrison
304,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now after this larger meeting with Vice President Pence and President Zelensky, you testified at your deposition that you saw Ambassador Sondland immediately go over and pull Andrey Yermak aside and have a conversation. Is that right?",01:22:24,Volker/Morrison
305,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I mean it was, President Zelensky left the room. Vice President Pence left the room. And in sort of an anteroom, Ambassador Sondland and presidential advisor Yermak had this discussion. Yes.",01:22:38,Volker/Morrison
306,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And what did ambassador Sondland tell you that he told Mr. Yermak?,01:22:51,Volker/Morrison
307,Section_0,Tim Morrison,That the Ukrainians would have to have the prosecutor general make a statement with respect to the investigations as a condition of having the aid lifted.,01:22:58,Volker/Morrison
308,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And you testified that you were not comfortable with what Ambassador Sondland had told you. Why not?,01:23:10,Volker/Morrison
309,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Well, I was concerned about what I saw as essentially an additional hurdle to accomplishing what I had been directed to help accomplish, which was giving the president the information he needed to determine that the security sector assistance could go forward.",01:23:17,Volker/Morrison
310,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"So now there’s a whole other wrinkle to it, right?",01:23:35,Volker/Morrison
311,Section_0,Tim Morrison,There was the appearance of one based on what Ambassador Sondland represented.,01:23:38,Volker/Morrison
312,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And you told Ambassador Taylor about this conversation as well. Is that right?,01:23:42,Volker/Morrison
313,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I promptly reached out to Ambassador Taylor to schedule a secure phone call.,01:23:45,Volker/Morrison
314,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And in your deposition you testified that his testimony other than one small distinction between President Zelensky and the prosecutor general was accurate as to what you told him. Is that correct?,01:23:50,Volker/Morrison
315,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"About that conversation, yes.",01:24:01,Volker/Morrison
316,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And generally speaking, you confirmed everything that Ambassador Taylor told you except for that one thing and a small other ministerial matter relating to the location of a meeting. Is that correct?",01:24:02,Volker/Morrison
317,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct.,01:24:13,Volker/Morrison
318,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Now did you tell Ambassador Bolton about this conversation as well?,01:24:14,Volker/Morrison
319,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I reached out to him as well and requested his availability for a secure phone call.,01:24:18,Volker/Morrison
320,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And what was his response when you explained to him what Ambassador Sondland had said?,01:24:22,Volker/Morrison
321,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Tell the lawyers.,01:24:27,Volker/Morrison
322,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Did you go tell the lawyers?,01:24:29,Volker/Morrison
323,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"When I returned to the states, yes.",01:24:30,Volker/Morrison
324,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And did he explain to you why he wanted you to tell the lawyers?,01:24:32,Volker/Morrison
325,Section_0,Tim Morrison,He did not.,01:24:34,Volker/Morrison
326,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Now a few days later on September 7th, you spoke again to Ambassador Sondland who told you that he had just gotten off the phone with President Trump. Isn’t that right?",01:24:36,Volker/Morrison
327,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"That sounds correct, yes.",01:24:46,Volker/Morrison
328,Section_0,Dan Goldman,What did Ambassador Sondland tell you that president Trump said to him?,01:24:48,Volker/Morrison
329,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"If I recall this conversation correctly, this was where Ambassador Sondland related that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky had to make the statement and that he had to want to do it.",01:24:53,Volker/Morrison
330,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And by that point did you understand that the statement related to the Biden in 2016 investigations?,01:25:09,Volker/Morrison
331,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I think I did, yes.",01:25:17,Volker/Morrison
332,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And that that was essentially a condition for the security assistance to be released?,01:25:20,Volker/Morrison
333,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I understood that that’s what Ambassador Sondland believed,01:25:24,Volker/Morrison
334,Section_0,Dan Goldman,After speaking with President Trump?,01:25:28,Volker/Morrison
335,Section_0,Tim Morrison,That’s what he represented.,01:25:30,Volker/Morrison
336,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Now you testified that hearing this information gave you a sinking feeling. Why was that?,01:25:32,Volker/Morrison
337,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Well, I believe if we’re all on September 7th, the end of the fiscal year, September 30th, these are one year dollars, the DOD and the Department Of State funds. So we only had so much time. And in fact, because Congress imposed a 15 day notification requirement on the state department funds September 7th, September 30th, that really means September 15th in order to secure a decision from the president to allow the funds to go forward.",01:25:37,Volker/Morrison
338,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Did you tell Ambassador Bolton about this conversation as well?,01:26:06,Volker/Morrison
339,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I did, yes.",01:26:10,Volker/Morrison
340,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And what did he say to you?,01:26:10,Volker/Morrison
341,Section_0,Tim Morrison,He said to tell the lawyers.,01:26:12,Volker/Morrison
342,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And why did he say to tell the lawyers?,01:26:13,Volker/Morrison
343,Section_0,Tim Morrison,He did not explain his direction.,01:26:15,Volker/Morrison
344,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"But he’s not going to… He doesn’t tell you to go tell the lawyers because you’re running up on the eight day deadline there, right?",01:26:17,Volker/Morrison
345,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Again, I don’t know why he directed that, but it seemed reasonable and it’s consistent with what I was going to do anyway.",01:26:25,Volker/Morrison
346,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Right. And you weren’t going to go tell them because of that concern. Right? You were concerned about what you were hearing Ambassador Sondland relay to you. Correct?,01:26:30,Volker/Morrison
347,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct.,01:26:39,Volker/Morrison
348,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"So just so we’re clear, you reported two concerning conversations that you had with Ambassador Sondland to the lawyers in early September, in which you understood from him that the president was withholding security assistance as additional leverage to get Ukraine to publicly announce the specific political investigations that President Trump had discussed on the July 25th call. Is that accurate?",01:26:40,Volker/Morrison
349,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I was concerned about what Ambassador Sondland was saying were requirements, yes.",01:27:04,Volker/Morrison
350,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Right. And you understood though that the investigations that Ambassador Sondland was referring to were the two that President Trump referenced on the July 25th call, correct?",01:27:09,Volker/Morrison
351,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"By this point, yes.",01:27:17,Volker/Morrison
352,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"And during this early September time period, Mr. Morrison, did you have any conversations with Ambassador Volker about any of this?",01:27:18,Volker/Morrison
353,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I believe we had one conversation.,01:27:25,Volker/Morrison
354,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And what do you recall about that conversation?,01:27:27,Volker/Morrison
355,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I believe on or about September 6th, Ambassador Volker was in town to provide an update on some of his activities, and he provided that update and then we had a one on one conversation about this track, the separate process.",01:27:31,Volker/Morrison
356,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And what do you recall saying to him about the separate process?,01:27:51,Volker/Morrison
357,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I think I was interested in understanding his understanding of events.,01:27:54,Volker/Morrison
358,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Did you explain to him what your understanding of events was?,01:28:00,Volker/Morrison
359,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I think I was primarily on receive mode.,01:28:05,Volker/Morrison
360,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Okay. And Ambassador Volker, do you recall this conversation?",01:28:08,Volker/Morrison
361,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Thank you. I do remember a conversation with Tim. I’m not sure about the timing. I left around that time to go on a trip, and so it may have been a little bit earlier. I’m not sure about the timing. And what I do remember the discussion being is Tim asking me what is my impression of the role that Ambassador Sondland plays. And my response to that was, well, I find it helpful that he has political contacts in the White House. I don’t have those contacts. I’m working the national security, the diplomatic front, but I don’t have the political contacts. And so he’s able to use those to support the same goals that we are working toward. And I viewed that as helpful.",01:28:12,Volker/Morrison
362,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Well, that’s a good segue to our next exhibit, which is a September 8th text exchange with you and Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Sondland. And at the top, Ambassador Sondland says, “Guys, multiple convos with Z. That’s Zelensky. POTUS. Let’s talk.” And then Ambassador Taylor about 15-16 minutes later says, “Gordon and I just spoke. I can brief you, meaning you Ambassador Volker, if you and Gordon don’t connect.” Approximately one hour later, Ambassador Taylor says, “The nightmare is they give the interview and don’t get the security assistance. The Russians love it. And I quit.” And then at the bottom about five hours later, how do you respond?",01:28:56,Volker/Morrison
363,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I say, I’m not in the loop. Talk Monday.",01:29:40,Volker/Morrison
364,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"So you were not in the loop in terms of all of these conversations that Ambassador Taylor, Mr. Morrison, Ambassador Sondland were having?",01:29:43,Volker/Morrison
365,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, that’s correct.",01:29:51,Volker/Morrison
366,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And now ultimately the hold was lifted on September 11th. Is that right Ambassador Volker?,01:29:52,Volker/Morrison
367,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That’s my understanding.,01:29:57,Volker/Morrison
368,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"Okay. And Mr. Morrison, were you aware that prior to September 11th that there was a whistleblower complaint circulating around the White House?",01:29:59,Volker/Morrison
369,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I don’t believe so, no.",01:30:08,Volker/Morrison
370,Section_0,Dan Goldman,"But you were aware of a request to preserve records, were you not?",01:30:10,Volker/Morrison
371,Section_0,Tim Morrison,We received a number of those requests. I have a general recollection of one as related to Ukraine.,01:30:14,Volker/Morrison
372,Section_0,Dan Goldman,And one final question. When was the hold lifted?,01:30:21,Volker/Morrison
373,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"As I understand it, the president gave that direction the evening of September 11th.",01:30:24,Volker/Morrison
374,Section_0,Dan Goldman,Which is two days after the Congress announced an investigation. Were you aware of that?,01:30:28,Volker/Morrison
375,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I believe I was familiar with the letter from the three committee chairman.,01:30:31,Volker/Morrison
376,Section_0,Dan Goldman,I yield.,01:30:37,Volker/Morrison
377,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"That concludes the majority 45 minutes. Before I turn to the minority, are you both in your council okay? Or do you need a break? Okay. Ranking member Nunes, you’re recognized for 45 minutes.",01:30:37,Volker/Morrison
378,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Well Ambassador and Mr. Morrison, I have some bad news for you. TV ratings are way down, way down. Don’t hold it personally. I don’t think it’s you guys. But whatever drug deal the Democrats are cooking up here on the dais, American people aren’t buying it. I know you both answered this in your opening statements, but I just want to bring a little more clarity to it. Mr. Morrison, I’ll start with you. Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?",01:30:53,Volker/Morrison
379,Section_0,Tim Morrison,No sir.,01:31:33,Volker/Morrison
380,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"And you were the top person for Ukraine in the White House, correct? At the NSC level?",01:31:34,Volker/Morrison
381,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I would argue Ambassador Bolton would be.,01:31:39,Volker/Morrison
382,Section_0,Adam Schiff,Reporting to Ambassador Bolton.,01:31:42,Volker/Morrison
383,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I was a senior official, yes sir.",01:31:43,Volker/Morrison
384,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador Volker, You have a storied career. We’re very thankful for your service. And you were the special Envoy to Ukraine.",01:31:46,Volker/Morrison
385,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:31:53,Volker/Morrison
386,Section_0,Adam Schiff,did anyone at the White House ever ask you to bribe or extort anything out of anyone at any time?,01:31:55,Volker/Morrison
387,Section_0,Kurt Volker,No sir.,01:32:02,Volker/Morrison
388,Section_0,Adam Schiff,Thank you. I want to thank you both for being here. And I’ll yield to Mr. Caster.,01:32:03,Volker/Morrison
389,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Thank you both for being here today and also for participating in the lengthy depositions. Ambassador Volker, you were the first one on October 3rd, and Mr. Morrison. You were with us on Halloween. So thank you for your participation. Mr. Morrison, I also want to thank you. You’re a long time hill staffer. I certainly have appreciation for that, nearly 20 years, so thank you. And Ambassador Volker, Hatboro, Pennsylvania resident. That’s an incredible part of the country.",01:32:09,Volker/Morrison
390,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Very proud of it.,01:32:40,Volker/Morrison
391,Section_0,Devin Nunes,I’m from nearby. I just want to walk through some of your positions. You were a Senate confirmed ambassador to NATO for a stint?,01:32:41,Volker/Morrison
392,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:32:49,Volker/Morrison
393,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And then you were at the state department, and your portfolio span much of what I believe George Kent has currently.",01:32:50,Volker/Morrison
394,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I was the principal deputy assistant secretary, so I had all, working for the assistant secretary, had all of Europe and Eurasia and particular responsibility for NATO, Western Europe and European Union.",01:32:58,Volker/Morrison
395,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And then you’re involved with the National Security Council. You were the director for NATO in Western Europe?,01:33:09,Volker/Morrison
396,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:33:17,Volker/Morrison
397,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And then you were the senior director for European and Eurasian affairs.,01:33:17,Volker/Morrison
398,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I was acting for several months, six months or so.",01:33:22,Volker/Morrison
399,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. Much like [crosstalk 01:33:28] Mr. Morrison had. And we’ll note that all the witnesses that we have interacted with have just heaped praise on you. Ambassador Yovanovitch said you are a brilliant diplomat, and so that’s very high praise. And for over two years, you served as the special representative for Ukraine negotiations.",01:33:25,Volker/Morrison
400,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:33:49,Volker/Morrison
401,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And you served for free.,01:33:50,Volker/Morrison
402,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:33:52,Volker/Morrison
403,Section_0,Devin Nunes,You served on a voluntary basis.,01:33:54,Volker/Morrison
404,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I did.,01:33:55,Volker/Morrison
405,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And you put a lot of time and effort into that job, didn’t you?",01:33:56,Volker/Morrison
406,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I did.",01:34:00,Volker/Morrison
407,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And the tax payers certainly got their money’s worth, didn’t they?",01:34:01,Volker/Morrison
408,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Not for me to say.,01:34:03,Volker/Morrison
409,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And you believe America’s policy towards Ukraine has been strengthened during your tenure as the special representative?,01:34:07,Volker/Morrison
410,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Absolutely. When I look back at the record, I think we did an awful lot to support Ukraine.",01:34:15,Volker/Morrison
411,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Is it fair to say that’s in part due to President Trump?,01:34:20,Volker/Morrison
412,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"President Trump approved each of the decisions made along the way. Providing lethal defensive equipment and the non-recognition statement on Crimea, I think being two of the most important ones.",01:34:23,Volker/Morrison
413,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And for for many years there had been an initiative in the inner agency to advocate for lethal defensive weaponry for Ukraine. Is that correct?,01:34:35,Volker/Morrison
414,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:34:43,Volker/Morrison
415,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And it wasn’t until President Trump and his administration came in that that went through?,01:34:43,Volker/Morrison
416,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:34:49,Volker/Morrison
417,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"The delegation to President Zelensky’s inauguration in May, I believe you testified it was one of the largest delegations.",01:34:54,Volker/Morrison
418,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I believe it was. I can’t be 100% sure, but I believe it was the largest national delegation.",01:35:04,Volker/Morrison
419,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay. And included in the delegation was Secretary Perry?,01:35:10,Volker/Morrison
420,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland, myself, Senator Ron Johnson was there, and also the charge aid affair at the US embassy at the time, Joe Pennington.",01:35:14,Volker/Morrison
421,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. And we’ve talked a little bit this morning, but President Zelensky’s inauguration came together rather quickly?",01:35:23,Volker/Morrison
422,Section_0,Kurt Volker,It did. I believe we had about three days notice in which to put the delegation together.,01:35:36,Volker/Morrison
423,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"There’s been some discussion about whether the vice president was going to be able to lead that effort. And as it turned out, he was not able to lead it. Do you have any information as to why the vice president was unable to join?",01:35:40,Volker/Morrison
424,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I don’t.,01:35:52,Volker/Morrison
425,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And Mr. Morrison, do you have any information as to why the vice president was unable to participate in the delegation?",01:35:53,Volker/Morrison
426,Section_0,Tim Morrison,No.,01:36:01,Volker/Morrison
427,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Ambassador Volker, you testified during your deposition that aid in fact does get held up from time to time for a whole assortment of reasons. Is that your understanding?",01:36:05,Volker/Morrison
428,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is true.,01:36:16,Volker/Morrison
429,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And sometimes the holdups are rooted in something at OMB. Sometimes it’s at the defense department. Sometimes it’s just at the state department. Sometimes it’s on the hill, correct?",01:36:17,Volker/Morrison
430,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:36:28,Volker/Morrison
431,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And so when the aid was held up for 55 days for Ukraine, that didn’t in and of itself strike you as uncommon?",01:36:29,Volker/Morrison
432,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"No, it’s something that had happened in my career in the past. I’d seen holdups of assistance. I just assumed it was part of the decision making process. Somebody had an objection. We had to overcome it.",01:36:40,Volker/Morrison
433,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay. And in fact there were concerns that perhaps President Zelensky wasn’t going to be the reformer that he campaigned on?,01:36:51,Volker/Morrison
434,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That was a supposition that I made because of the meeting with the president on May 23rd. I thought that could be what’s behind it.,01:37:02,Volker/Morrison
435,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And in fact the aid was lifted shortly after he was able to convene a parliament?,01:37:10,Volker/Morrison
436,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I believe he, let me get the dates straight. I believe, yes. He was able to convene the parliament around the 1st of September, and I believe the aid was released on the 11th of September.",01:37:17,Volker/Morrison
437,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And when he was able to convene a parliament, he was able to push through a number of anticorruption initiatives?",01:37:28,Volker/Morrison
438,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"That began with the parliament seated on that day. It was a 24 hour session, but then it continued for some time.",01:37:34,Volker/Morrison
439,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And that was an encouraging sign?,01:37:39,Volker/Morrison
440,Section_0,Kurt Volker,It started off in a very encouraging way. Yes.,01:37:43,Volker/Morrison
441,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And other than these things going on in the background with the pause in the aid, the US relations with Ukraine, you testified or you stated it was about as good as you’d want them to be?",01:37:48,Volker/Morrison
442,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Can you repeat the question? I’m sorry.,01:38:01,Volker/Morrison
443,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"You testified at your deposition that once the aid was lifted, despite all the things going on in the background, that US Ukrainian relations were strong, were as good as you’d want them to be?",01:38:03,Volker/Morrison
444,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:38:12,Volker/Morrison
445,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And you referenced that the security sector assistance was lifted, any hold on that, that there was a positive meeting in New York?",01:38:13,Volker/Morrison
446,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:38:21,Volker/Morrison
447,Section_0,Devin Nunes,At the UNGA. And there was momentum and putting pressure on the Russians. Is that correct?,01:38:22,Volker/Morrison
448,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:38:28,Volker/Morrison
449,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"In your deposition, you made it clear that President Trump had a deep rooted negative view on Ukraine and their corruption environment?",01:38:33,Volker/Morrison
450,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:38:39,Volker/Morrison
451,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And you first became aware of his views back in September, 2017?",01:38:41,Volker/Morrison
452,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:38:47,Volker/Morrison
453,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Can you tell us a little bit about that?,01:38:48,Volker/Morrison
454,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes. In September of 2017, I was invited by Secretary Tillerson to do a pre-brief with President Trump before his meeting with President Poroshenko on the margins of the UN general assembly. I did the pre-brief and then I took part in the bilateral meeting.",01:38:49,Volker/Morrison
455,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And so long before President Zelensky was elected, President Trump had a negative view of Ukraine?",01:39:06,Volker/Morrison
456,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, he had a very strongly negative view.",01:39:13,Volker/Morrison
457,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Back in 2017, do you remember anything he said or did that gave you a feeling that he had these negative views?",01:39:15,Volker/Morrison
458,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes. I want to be very careful here because this was a bilateral meeting between the two presidents. I don’t want to stray into classified material. But I can tell you my impression was that he had a very strongly negative view of Ukraine at the time.,01:39:24,Volker/Morrison
459,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay, fair enough. And you described the president’s skepticism at your deposition as a reasonable position?",01:39:36,Volker/Morrison
460,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:39:46,Volker/Morrison
461,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And I believe you said most people who know anything about Ukraine would possibly think that?,01:39:47,Volker/Morrison
462,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:39:52,Volker/Morrison
463,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And you viewed it as part of your role to help change his mind that President Zelensky was a genuine reformer, that he was not running for office for self enrichment, that he was indeed a good person?",01:39:55,Volker/Morrison
464,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:40:10,Volker/Morrison
465,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"During the May 23rd meeting with the president in the oval office, could you just relay to us the concerns the president articulated about Ukraine?",01:40:18,Volker/Morrison
466,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes. The president came into the meeting and immediately started speaking. He had just a string of comments that Ukraine is a terrible place. They’re all corrupt. They’re terrible people. They tried to take me down. I tried to explain along with the others that were there. Each of us took turns speaking. I tried to explain that President Zelensky agrees with you, that he was elected because of that situation in Ukraine. And he has a strong mandate from the people of Ukraine to change it. And that’s why it’s important that we actually show him very strong support now. But the president was not convinced, and he said that Zelinsky is no different, that he has terrible people around him. It’s not what I hear about Ukraine, what we’re telling him. I hear that nothing has changed. Talk to Rudy, that kind of dialogue as I described.",01:40:29,Volker/Morrison
467,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And when the president said that the Ukrainians tried to take him down, did you have any idea what he was referring to?",01:41:29,Volker/Morrison
468,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I did. I believed that he was referring to the rumors of efforts to interfere in the 2016 election by providing damaging information about the president or about Paul Manafort to the Hillary Clinton campaign. That was one of the rumors that had been been out there and that had gotten some support from the Ukrainian prosecutor general.,01:41:34,Volker/Morrison
469,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And to the best of your knowledge, the president genuinely believed that. Right?",01:41:58,Volker/Morrison
470,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I believe he was concerned about it. I don’t know what he actually believed, but he brought it up.",01:42:03,Volker/Morrison
471,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. And Mr. Morrison, you are also aware of the president’s skeptical view of foreign aid generally?",01:42:07,Volker/Morrison
472,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:42:17,Volker/Morrison
473,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And that there was an initiative that he was looking at foreign aid pretty broadly?,01:42:17,Volker/Morrison
474,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:42:24,Volker/Morrison
475,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And trying to scrutinize to make sure the US taxpayers were getting their money’s worth?,01:42:25,Volker/Morrison
476,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:42:28,Volker/Morrison
477,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And the president was also interested, was he not, in better understanding opportunities for increased burden sharing among the Europeans?",01:42:31,Volker/Morrison
478,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:42:39,Volker/Morrison
479,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And what can you tell us about that?,01:42:40,Volker/Morrison
480,Section_0,Tim Morrison,The president was concerned that the United States seemed to bear the exclusive brunt of security assistance to Ukraine. He wanted to see the Europeans step up and contribute more security assistance.,01:42:43,Volker/Morrison
481,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And was there any inter-agency activity, whether it be with the state department or the defense department, coordination by the National Security Council to look into that a little bit for the president?",01:42:57,Volker/Morrison
482,Section_0,Tim Morrison,We were surveying the data to understand who was contributing what and sort of in what categories.,01:43:07,Volker/Morrison
483,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And so the president evinced concerns, the inter-agency tried to address them?",01:43:18,Volker/Morrison
484,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:43:25,Volker/Morrison
485,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And by late August, we just discussed with Ambassador Volker that a new Rata was seated. And did that give possibly some hope that President Zelensky would be able to push through some of these reforms?",01:43:26,Volker/Morrison
486,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:43:37,Volker/Morrison
487,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And did you hope during this time period, during this 55 days where the aid was paused, that potentially Zelensky would be able to demonstrate his bona fides and would subsequently be able to get the president to lift the aid?",01:43:39,Volker/Morrison
488,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:43:55,Volker/Morrison
489,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"In fact, you traveled with Ambassador Bolton to Ukraine right around labor day weekend, correct?",01:44:01,Volker/Morrison
490,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:44:13,Volker/Morrison
491,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And you met with President Zelensky on, I believe it was August 29th?",01:44:13,Volker/Morrison
492,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Ambassador Bolton had a meeting with President Zelensky and I staffed that meeting.,01:44:19,Volker/Morrison
493,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And that’s right around the time when the Rata had met and they had started to push through their reforms?,01:44:23,Volker/Morrison
494,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"As I recall, the date of the meeting between Ambassador Bolton and President Zelensky was actually the first day of the new Rata.",01:44:28,Volker/Morrison
495,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And some of these reforms included naming a new prosecutor general?,01:44:35,Volker/Morrison
496,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"A new prosecutor general, a brand new cabinet. Yes.",01:44:41,Volker/Morrison
497,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And they pushed through some legislation that eliminated immunity for Rata members?,01:44:45,Volker/Morrison
498,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Yes, eliminating parliamentary immunity.",01:44:50,Volker/Morrison
499,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And I believe you provided some color into this experience, this meeting, and you said that the Ukrainians had been up all night working on some of these…",01:44:53,Volker/Morrison
500,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Ukrainians had been up all night, working on some of these legislative initiatives.",01:45:03,Volker/Morrison
501,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Yes. The Ukrainians, with whom we met, were by all appearances exhausted, from the pace of activity.",01:45:06,Volker/Morrison
502,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Was Ambassador Bolton encouraged by the activity?,01:45:12,Volker/Morrison
503,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Yes, he was.",01:45:15,Volker/Morrison
504,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And was the meeting altogether favorable?,01:45:16,Volker/Morrison
505,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Quite.,01:45:18,Volker/Morrison
506,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"At that point in time, after the meeting, Ambassador Bolton did he head off to Warsaw, with the Vice President, or did he just… I know you went to Warsaw.",01:45:22,Volker/Morrison
507,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Well, we had a few stops between Ukraine and Poland, but yes, Ambassador Bolton proceeded to Warsaw, where we were expecting to ensure everything was staged properly, for the President’s arrival.",01:45:33,Volker/Morrison
508,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Did you have an opportunity to brief the Vice President on-,01:45:48,Volker/Morrison
509,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I did not.,01:45:51,Volker/Morrison
510,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Did Ambassador Bolton?,01:45:52,Volker/Morrison
511,Section_0,Tim Morrison,He did.,01:45:53,Volker/Morrison
512,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"What do you remember, from what Ambassador Bolton shared with the Vice President, about the Zelensky meeting?",01:45:54,Volker/Morrison
513,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"So, I was not there. The issue I remember most starkly was Ambassador Bolton was quite annoyed that Ambassador [inaudible 01:46:10] had crashed the pre-brief.",01:46:00,Volker/Morrison
514,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay.,01:46:11,Volker/Morrison
515,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"But the Ambassador had everything he needed to ensure that, either the President, or the Vice President were well-prepared.",01:46:12,Volker/Morrison
516,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Did you brief Ambassador Bolton before he had an opportunity to meet with Vice President?,01:46:21,Volker/Morrison
517,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I didn’t need to. I was… Ambassador Bolton was there.,01:46:26,Volker/Morrison
518,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. But as far as you know, Ambassador Bolton communicated it to the Vice President that the goings on in Ukraine were positive?",01:46:29,Volker/Morrison
519,Section_0,Tim Morrison,That’s my understanding.,01:46:38,Volker/Morrison
520,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"With President Zelensky. At this time, Ambassador Bolton was advocating for the lifting of the aid?",01:46:39,Volker/Morrison
521,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"He had been for some time, yes.",01:46:45,Volker/Morrison
522,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Did you participate in the Warsaw meetings?,01:46:50,Volker/Morrison
523,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"We had a reduced schedule, from what had been arranged for the precedent, for the Vice President, but the Vice President met with President Duda, of Poland, and he met with President Zelensky, and I participated in both meetings.",01:46:54,Volker/Morrison
524,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"What do you remember from the meeting, with President Zelensky?",01:47:07,Volker/Morrison
525,Section_0,Tim Morrison,It seemed very positive. Very [crosstalk 01:47:13].,01:47:12,Volker/Morrison
526,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"What was the message? President Zelensky, he raised the issue of the aid, correct?",01:47:13,Volker/Morrison
527,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:47:17,Volker/Morrison
528,Section_0,Devin Nunes,How did the Vice President respond?,01:47:18,Volker/Morrison
529,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"He represented his support for the aid. He represented the strong commitment of the United States to Ukraine, and he explained that President Trump, because this is after the Politico article had come out, that made clear there was a hold, he explained that what we were doing was the United States government, the inter agency, was examining what more Europe could do in the security space, and taking a look at how Ukraine was reforming what has been a history of corruption.",01:47:20,Volker/Morrison
530,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Was there any discussion, during the meeting with President [inaudible 00:03: 01], on the part of the Vice President, about any of these investigations we’ve come to talk about?",01:47:57,Volker/Morrison
531,Section_0,Tim Morrison,No.,01:48:06,Volker/Morrison
532,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"So, Burisma wasn’t raised?",01:48:08,Volker/Morrison
533,Section_0,Tim Morrison,No.,01:48:11,Volker/Morrison
534,Section_0,Devin Nunes,2016 election wasn’t raised?,01:48:12,Volker/Morrison
535,Section_0,Tim Morrison,No.,01:48:15,Volker/Morrison
536,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And the Vice President didn’t mention any investigations at all, did he?",01:48:16,Volker/Morrison
537,Section_0,Tim Morrison,No.,01:48:20,Volker/Morrison
538,Section_0,Devin Nunes,You mentioned the August 28th Politico article. Was that the first time that you believe that Ukrainians may have had a real sense that the aid was on hold?,01:48:25,Volker/Morrison
539,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,01:48:34,Volker/Morrison
540,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"So, from the 55 day period, spanning July 18th through September 11th, it didn’t really become public until August 28th?",01:48:35,Volker/Morrison
541,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"That’s correct. Ambassador Taylor and I had a number of phone calls where we, in fact, talked about, “Do the Ukrainians know yet,” because we both felt very strongly it was important that we ensure that the President was able to make the decision to release the aid before the Ukrainians ever found out about it.",01:48:46,Volker/Morrison
542,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay, Ambassador Volker, is that also your recollection?",01:49:01,Volker/Morrison
543,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, it is.",01:49:05,Volker/Morrison
544,Section_0,Devin Nunes,That it wasn’t until the Politico article that-,01:49:07,Volker/Morrison
545,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"That’s correct. I received a text message, from one of my Ukrainian counterparts, on August 29th, forwarding that article, and that’s the first they raised it with me.",01:49:09,Volker/Morrison
546,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Can you share a little bit with us about your communications, during that time period, about the hold in the aid?",01:49:18,Volker/Morrison
547,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes. I didn’t have any communications with the Ukrainians about the hold on aid until after they raised it with me, for the same reason that Tim just gave, on the hope that we could get it taken care of ourselves, before it became something that they became aware of. Inside the U.S. government, I was aware that the hold was placed. I was aware of that on July 18th. It was referenced at an inter agency meeting, and I got a read out from that meeting, from one of my assistants.",01:49:25,Volker/Morrison
548,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I, then, immediately spoke with several people in the administration, to object. I thought that this was a bad decision, or a bad hold, maybe not a decision, but a process. I wanted to make sure that all the arguments were marshaled, to get it lifted. So, I spoke with the Pentagon, [inaudible 01:50:14] Cooper, I spoke with Assistant Secretary of [inaudible 01:50:17] affairs at the state department, who was going to represent the state department at the next higher level meeting. I believe I spoke with officials in European Bureau, with the national security council staff. So, I was actively trying to convey that this needed to be lifted and I wanted them to be able to use my name in doing so, because I felt that the best prospect for positioning ourselves for negotiations with Russia, is the strongest defense capability for Ukraine.",01:49:55,Volker/Morrison
549,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"During this time period, did you come to believe that any of these investigations were part of the hold up in the aid?",01:50:46,Volker/Morrison
550,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"No, I did not.",01:50:53,Volker/Morrison
551,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Backtracking just a little bit. On July 3rd, you met in Toronto with President Zelensky, and there’s been some… Ambassador Taylor, and Mr. Kent provided some testimony that they had some apprehension, that part of this irregular channel, that Ambassador Taylor referenced, what would rear its head in Toronto. I’m just wondering if you can tell us whether that in fact happened.",01:50:55,Volker/Morrison
552,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, thank you. I can only tell you what I know. There may have been other conversations, or other things, but I know that we had a conversation, Bill Taylor, and I believe Gordon Sondland, and I, around the 28th of June. That later connected to, I believe, a conversation with President Zelensky, although I may not have been part of the latter. That being said, I was convinced after that conversation we had gotten nowhere. We had our White House briefing of President Trump, on May 23rd. He signed a letter inviting President Zelensky to the White House on May 29th, and for several weeks, we were just temporizing with Ukrainians, saying, “Well, we’re working on it. It’s a scheduling issue. We’ll get there, don’t worry.”",01:51:26,Volker/Morrison
553,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I told Bill, and Gordon, that I was going to see President Zelensky in Toronto, and I feel an obligation to tell him the truth. That we have a problem here, we’re not getting a date scheduled, here’s what I think the problem is. It’s the negative information flow from Mayor Giuliani. Also, that I would advise him that he should call President Trump personally, because he needed to renew that personal relationship, and be able to convey to President Trump that he was serious about fighting corruption, investigating things that happened in the past and so forth. So, I did all of that with President Zelensky in a [inaudible 00:07:50], after our formal bilateral meeting.",01:52:11,Volker/Morrison
554,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. During that meeting in Toronto, or the series of meetings, there was no discussion of preconditions, and investigations of anything?",01:52:52,Volker/Morrison
555,Section_0,Kurt Volker,No.,01:53:01,Volker/Morrison
556,Section_0,Devin Nunes,That sort?,01:53:02,Volker/Morrison
557,Section_0,Kurt Volker,No.,01:53:02,Volker/Morrison
558,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And you were there with Mr. Kent?,01:53:03,Volker/Morrison
559,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I believe so.",01:53:06,Volker/Morrison
560,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And did you ever have any discussions with him about preconditions or investigations?,01:53:07,Volker/Morrison
561,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Not at that time. I think later on, these things came up, about when we were talking about a statement. Whether there were investigations, but I believe at this time in Toronto, it was really more referring to investigations generically, that that is how you go about fighting corruption, and that President Zelensky should reaffirm his commitment to President Trump in a direct phone call.",01:53:13,Volker/Morrison
562,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay. At any point in time had Mr. Kent raised any concerns to you about any of this?,01:53:35,Volker/Morrison
563,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Not at that time.,01:53:43,Volker/Morrison
564,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Next event I want to cover is the July 10th meeting, in Ambassador Bolton’s office. We talked a little bit about it this morning. I don’t if you had caught the coverage, but there was a testimony that at some point Ambassador Sondland mentioned investigations, and reportedly that the meeting ended abruptly. What can you tell us about that, in fact?",01:53:46,Volker/Morrison
565,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Thank you. Let me answer that question first. I’d like to come back to your prior question for a second, too, if I may, but on the July 10th meeting, this was a meeting that we had arranged between Alex Danyliuk, who was the head of the National Security and Defense Council, and the National Security Advisor Bolton. Attending the meeting was also Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland, myself, I believe Fiona Hill, and also Andriy Yermak. The purpose was really a counterpart visit. I thought that this would be the best opportunity, it was the first high level meeting that we were having in Washington, with a senior U.S. official, Ambassador Bolton after President Zelensky’s inauguration. I thought it’d be a great opportunity for the Ukrainians to make their case, that they are the new team in town. Real deal about fighting corruption. I was rather disappointed with the meeting. As it transpired, it struck me as down in the weeds, talking about a reform of national security structures in Ukraine, legislation that they were working on, and not the big picture and not the bilateral relationship. So, I was a bit disappointed by that.",01:54:10,Volker/Morrison
566,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"At the end of the meeting, I do recall, having seen some of the other testimony, I believe in Ambassador Sondland did raise the point of investigations, in a generic way. This was after the meeting was already wrapping up, and I think all of us thought it was inappropriate, and the conversation did not pick up from there. The meeting was over. We all went outside, and we had a picture taken in front of the White House, and then all of us except Ambassador Bolton, went down to the wardroom to talk through followup. About, “Well, how do we follow up on this meeting, to keep the momentum in the relationship?” I think we broke up into several small groups. I remember having a conversation with Secretary Perry, and one of his assistants, about energy reform as part of that. I don’t recall other conversations following up on investigations, or Burisma.",01:55:26,Volker/Morrison
567,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And to the best of your knowledge, there certainly was no precondition discussed, right?",01:56:23,Volker/Morrison
568,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"No, no. Again, the issue of the security assistance was one where I thought that this was really related to a general negative view about Ukraine. There was nothing specific ever communicated to me about it, or the reasons why it was held. We certainly didn’t want to talk about it with the Ukrainians. We wanted to fix it.",01:56:31,Volker/Morrison
569,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. A couple weeks later, the July 25th call happened, and you were headed to Ukraine, during that time period?",01:56:54,Volker/Morrison
570,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I was actually already on my way to Ukraine, I think two days prior to that.",01:57:06,Volker/Morrison
571,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And you receive readouts both from the U.S. side and the Ukrainian side. Could you tell us about it?,01:57:12,Volker/Morrison
572,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes. So, I was not on the phone call. I had arrived in Ukraine, and I had had that lunch with Mr. Yermak that we saw on the day of the phone call. I had been pushing for the phone call, because I thought it was important to renew the personal connection between the two leaders, and to congratulate President Zelensky on the parliamentary election. The readout that I received from Mr. Yermak, and then also from the U.S. side, although I’m not exactly sure who it was from on the U.S. side, but there was a U.S. and a Ukrainian readout, were largely the same. That it was a good call, it was a congratulatory phone call for the President’s win in the parliamentary election. President Zelensky did reiterate his commitment to reform, and fighting corruption in Ukraine, and President Trump did reiterate his invitation to President Zelensky to come visit him in the White House. That’s exactly what I thought the phone call would be, so I was not surprised at getting that as the readout.",01:57:17,Volker/Morrison
573,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Did you ever have any discussions with Ambassador Taylor about this?,01:58:16,Volker/Morrison
574,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"At that time. We were together, in Ukraine, at that time. We went the very next day to visit the conflict zone, and I’m sure he heard the same readout that I did.",01:58:19,Volker/Morrison
575,Section_0,Devin Nunes,You had a meeting with President Zelensky on the 26th?,01:58:28,Volker/Morrison
576,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, we had a meeting the day after the phone call, on the 26th. In the morning, before heading out to the conflict zone.",01:58:31,Volker/Morrison
577,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Were any of these concerning? Elements that some witnesses have raised about the call, raised in the meeting with President Zelensky?",01:58:36,Volker/Morrison
578,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"No, only the very bare bones readout that I had received. That was also how it was discussed in the meeting with President Zelensky.",01:58:42,Volker/Morrison
579,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"So, to the extent there’s been assertions that President Zelensky was concerned about demands President Trump had made.",01:58:50,Volker/Morrison
580,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I don’t recall that.,01:58:59,Volker/Morrison
581,Section_0,Devin Nunes,You don’t recall that?,01:59:00,Volker/Morrison
582,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I do not recall being… Well, let me turn that around, and say he was very positive about the phone call.",01:59:02,Volker/Morrison
583,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay.,01:59:07,Volker/Morrison
584,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I don’t recall him saying anything about demands, but he was very upbeat about the fact of the call.",01:59:08,Volker/Morrison
585,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. There was no discussion, on the part of President Zelensky, on how to navigate the various…",01:59:12,Volker/Morrison
586,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I don’t recall that.,01:59:18,Volker/Morrison
587,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Concerns that people have articulated about the call.,01:59:19,Volker/Morrison
588,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I don’t remember that.,01:59:22,Volker/Morrison
589,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Mr. Zeldin asked you in the deposition that in no way, shape or form, in either readouts from the United States, or Ukraine, did you receive any indication whatsoever for anything that resembled a quid pro quo? Is that correct?",01:59:28,Volker/Morrison
590,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:59:42,Volker/Morrison
591,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And the same would go for this new allegation of bribery?,01:59:43,Volker/Morrison
592,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I’ve only seen an allegation of bribery in the last week.,01:59:50,Volker/Morrison
593,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. It’s the same common set of facts. It’s just instead of quid pro quo, now it’s bribery.",01:59:53,Volker/Morrison
594,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I was never involved in anything that I considered to be bribery at all.,01:59:58,Volker/Morrison
595,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Or extortion?,02:00:03,Volker/Morrison
596,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Or extortion.,02:00:04,Volker/Morrison
597,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay.,02:00:05,Volker/Morrison
598,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Mr. Castor, may I address two specific points?",02:00:09,Volker/Morrison
599,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Of course.,02:00:12,Volker/Morrison
600,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"One is I’m reminded that the meeting with Ambassador Bolton, and Mr. Danyliuk, took place on July 10th.",02:00:14,Volker/Morrison
601,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Yes.,02:00:21,Volker/Morrison
602,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I did not become aware of the hold on security assistance until July 18th.,02:00:22,Volker/Morrison
603,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Right. Okay.,02:00:26,Volker/Morrison
604,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"So, that is another reason why that did not come up.",02:00:27,Volker/Morrison
605,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. At that point in time, you didn’t know that the potential pause in the security assistance was brewing?",02:00:28,Volker/Morrison
606,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I did not. No, I heard about it for the first time on the 18th of July.",02:00:36,Volker/Morrison
607,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay.,02:00:39,Volker/Morrison
608,Section_0,Kurt Volker,May I make a second observation as well?,02:00:40,Volker/Morrison
609,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Absolutely.,02:00:41,Volker/Morrison
610,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"I do remember, having seen some of the testimony of Mr. Kent, a conversation in which he had asked me about the conspiracy theories that were out there, in Ukraine. I don’t remember what the date of this conversation was, and my view was, “Well, if there are things like that, then why not investigate them?” [inaudible 02:01:01], I don’t believe that there’s anything to them. If there is, the 2016 election interference is what I was thinking of, we would want to know about that, but I didn’t really believe there’s anything there to begin with.",02:00:42,Volker/Morrison
611,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"You testified in your deposition to the extent that Ukrainians were going to investigate other Ukrainians for wrongdoing, that was perfectly appropriate in your mind?",02:01:12,Volker/Morrison
612,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Correct. That has been U.S. policy for years.,02:01:18,Volker/Morrison
613,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"So, if certain Ukrainians involved with the Burisma company, if they-",02:01:21,Volker/Morrison
614,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Well, that, I think, is the plausible thing to look at there. As I said, I don’t find it plausible, or credible, that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties, but whether individual Ukrainians in the society that we know Ukraine has been for decades, were trying to act in a corrupt way, or to buy influence, that’s plausible.",02:01:27,Volker/Morrison
615,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent, last Wednesday told us about there was an investigation, into Burisma, trying to recoup millions of taxpayer dollars, and the Ukrainians were pursuing an investigation, there was a bribe paid. Were you tracking that?",02:01:50,Volker/Morrison
616,Section_0,Kurt Volker,I was aware of those kinds of things. I couldn’t give you those kinds of details. I just know that there was a reputation around the company.,02:02:09,Volker/Morrison
617,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. Subsequent to those facts, and the bribe being paid, the Burisma company wanted to improve their image, and added some folks to their board, including the President of Poland, including Hunter Biden. Are you familiar with that?",02:02:17,Volker/Morrison
618,Section_0,Kurt Volker,That’s what I understand.,02:02:34,Volker/Morrison
619,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"To the extent the Ukrainians, that the folks affiliated with Burisma wanted to hire those people for their board, for protection purposes, so they could continue to engage in misdeeds. If that was a fact worth investigating, you certainly would be supportive of Ukrainians trying to get to the bottom of that, correct?",02:02:34,Volker/Morrison
620,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Well, I can’t speculate as to any of the specifics of what was motivating Burisma, or not. Ukrainian government authorities investigating possible corruption by Ukrainian citizens is a perfectly appropriate thing for them to do.",02:02:56,Volker/Morrison
621,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"All right. Mr. Morrison, I want to turn our attention back to the July 25th call. You were in the room. Did anything concern you on the call?",02:03:09,Volker/Morrison
622,Section_0,Tim Morrison,No.,02:03:27,Volker/Morrison
623,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"After the call ended, you, like Colonel Vindman, one of your next steps was to engage the NSC lawyers, and your reasons for doing that were slightly different than Colonel Vindman’s. You articulated three concerns, and do you want to share them with us, or would you rather I do it?",02:03:29,Volker/Morrison
624,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"So, I think I articulated two concerns. If I’m forgetting one, please remind me, but the two concerns I had were, one, I did not see representatives of NSC legal on the call, and so I wanted to make sure that the legal advisor and his deputy were aware of the call. I was also concerned about taking steps to protect the Memcon limited it’s disclosure, for fear of the consequences of it leaking.",02:03:56,Volker/Morrison
625,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"You were concerned about it leaking, because you were worried about how it would play out in Washington’s polarized political environment, correct?",02:04:26,Volker/Morrison
626,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:04:34,Volker/Morrison
627,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"You were also worried how that would lead to the bipartisan support, here in Congress, towards Ukraine, right?",02:04:35,Volker/Morrison
628,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:04:45,Volker/Morrison
629,Section_0,Devin Nunes,You were also concerned that it might affect the Ukrainians perception negatively?,02:04:47,Volker/Morrison
630,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:04:53,Volker/Morrison
631,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"In fact, all three of those things have played out, haven’t they?",02:04:54,Volker/Morrison
632,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:04:58,Volker/Morrison
633,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"You didn’t ask the lawyers to put it on the codeword system, correct?",02:04:59,Volker/Morrison
634,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I want to be precise about the lexicon here. I did not ask for it to be moved to a compartmented system.,02:05:08,Volker/Morrison
635,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay. You just wanted the transcript to be controlled?,02:05:14,Volker/Morrison
636,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I wanted access to be restricted.,02:05:20,Volker/Morrison
637,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. When you learned that the transcript had been stored on the compartmented server, you believe that was a mistake, correct?",02:05:22,Volker/Morrison
638,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Well, it was represented to me that it was a mistake. I was trying to pull up that Memcon, because we were in the process of pulling together Ambassador Bolton’s materials, and the President’s materials, for what was a plan bilat between POTUS and President Zelensky. When I went to do that, I could not pull up the package in our system, and I did not understand why. I spoke with the NSC executive Secretariat Staff, asked them why, and they did their research, and they informed me it had been moved to the higher classification system, at the direction of John Eisenberg, whom I then asked why. If that was the judgment he made, that’s not necessarily mine to question, but I didn’t understand it. He essentially told me, “I gave no such direction.” He did his own inquiry, and he represented back to me that it was his understanding was it is an administrative error, that when he also gave direction to restrict access, the executive Secretariat staff understood that as an apprehension that there was something in the content of the Memcon that could not exist on the lower classification system.",02:05:36,Volker/Morrison
639,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"So, to the best of your knowledge, there’s no malicious intent, in moving the transcript to the compartmented server?",02:06:48,Volker/Morrison
640,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct.,02:06:54,Volker/Morrison
641,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"To your knowledge, anybody on the NSC staff that needed access to the transcript for their official duties, always was able to access it, correct? people that had a need to know, and a need to access it.",02:06:54,Volker/Morrison
642,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Once it was moved to the compartmented system?,02:07:09,Volker/Morrison
643,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Yeah.,02:07:10,Volker/Morrison
644,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:07:11,Volker/Morrison
645,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. The Memcon of the July 25th call was, in your experience, prepared normally?",02:07:12,Volker/Morrison
646,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:07:22,Volker/Morrison
647,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"There isn’t an exact transcription of what’s said on the call, correct?",02:07:24,Volker/Morrison
648,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct.,02:07:29,Volker/Morrison
649,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"That there’s note-takers in the situation room, and then they prepare a draft, and it’s circulated among relevant parties?",02:07:30,Volker/Morrison
650,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Essentially. Yes.,02:07:39,Volker/Morrison
651,Section_0,Devin Nunes,You had responsibility for coordinating any edits?,02:07:42,Volker/Morrison
652,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Yes. We look at, shorthand, we’ll call it a transcript, but the memorandum of conversation, and we ensure that that transcription is as close to accurate as possible, given our requirements under the Presidential Records Act.",02:07:47,Volker/Morrison
653,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay. Colonel Vindman testified that he thought it was very accurate. Did you as well?,02:08:04,Volker/Morrison
654,Section_0,Tim Morrison,I viewed it as complete and accurate.,02:08:11,Volker/Morrison
655,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. Colonel Vindman did articulate that he had a couple edits. He wanted Burisma inserted, I think it was on page three, or four, in place of “the company”, in one of the sections where President Zelensky was talking. Are you aware of that edit request?",02:08:13,Volker/Morrison
656,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I understand that he said in either this proceeding, or the deposition that he wanted that request, yes.",02:08:32,Volker/Morrison
657,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. At the time, did you understand that he had asked for that?",02:08:38,Volker/Morrison
658,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I don’t recall that. It was my practice if I believed an edit accurately represented the call, I would accept it. If I didn’t hear it in the call, if it didn’t exist in my notes, I wouldn’t have made the edit.",02:08:41,Volker/Morrison
659,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. Yeah. On page four, he wanted to swap out the word company for Burisma. When that edit from Colonel Vindman was not installed, did he give you any negative feedback? That it was crucial that that edit get in the document?",02:08:54,Volker/Morrison
660,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Not that I can recall.,02:09:16,Volker/Morrison
661,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay. Did he ever raise any concerns to you about the accuracy of the transcript?,02:09:17,Volker/Morrison
662,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Not that I can recall.,02:09:23,Volker/Morrison
663,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Did he ever raise any concerns to you generally about the call?,02:09:26,Volker/Morrison
664,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"when we were discussing the track changes version of the Memcon, I believe he had some concerns about the call. I believe we both agreed we wanted that more full throated embrace of President Zelensky, and his reform agenda, and we didn’t get it.",02:09:30,Volker/Morrison
665,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. You indicated in your deposition that when you took over the portfolio for Dr. Hill, July 15th, you were alerted to potential issues in Colonel Vindman’s judgment?",02:09:50,Volker/Morrison
666,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:10:13,Volker/Morrison
667,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Did she relay anything specifically to you, why she thought that?",02:10:15,Volker/Morrison
668,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Not as such. It was more of a overarching statement from her, and her deputy, who became my deputy, that they had concerns about judgment.",02:10:21,Volker/Morrison
669,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay. Did any other NSC personnel raise concerns with you about Mr. Vindman?,02:10:32,Volker/Morrison
670,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:10:40,Volker/Morrison
671,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Or I’m sorry, Colonel Vindman. What were some of those concerns that were brought to your attention?",02:10:41,Volker/Morrison
672,Section_0,Tim Morrison,There were-,02:10:47,Volker/Morrison
673,Section_0,Speaker 1,"I’m sorry, we are not going to… I’m going to instruct him not to answer that. I’m going to instruct him not to answer, because I think that it’s beyond the scope of what you’re asking for. These concerns, Mr. Castor, predated any involvement in with Ukrainian sector assistance.",02:10:49,Volker/Morrison
674,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Well, during the deposition I asked you, Mr. Morrison, whether others raised the concern that Colonel Vindman may have leaked information.",02:11:11,Volker/Morrison
675,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"You did ask that, yes.",02:11:22,Volker/Morrison
676,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Yeah, and your answer was?",02:11:23,Volker/Morrison
677,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Others had represented that, yes.",02:11:25,Volker/Morrison
678,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. I asked you whether you were concerned Colonel Vindman did not keep you in the loop at all times, with his official duties?",02:11:27,Volker/Morrison
679,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:11:37,Volker/Morrison
680,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"In fact, when he went to the national security council lawyers following July 25th call, he did not first come to you. Is that correct?",02:11:38,Volker/Morrison
681,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct.,02:11:46,Volker/Morrison
682,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"And you were his supervisor in the chain of command, correct?",02:11:47,Volker/Morrison
683,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Correct.,02:11:52,Volker/Morrison
684,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"In hindsight, did you wish that he had come to you first, before going to the lawyers?",02:11:53,Volker/Morrison
685,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:11:58,Volker/Morrison
686,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And why is that?,02:11:59,Volker/Morrison
687,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"One, if he had concerns about something about the content of the call, that’s something I would expected to have been notified of. I also think, just as a matter of practice, since we both went to the lawyers, we didn’t necessarily both need to, and economy of effort may have prevailed.",02:12:01,Volker/Morrison
688,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. At any point subsequently, did he become frustrated that he felt cut out of some of the Ukraine portfolio?",02:12:18,Volker/Morrison
689,Section_0,Tim Morrison,Yes.,02:12:27,Volker/Morrison
690,Section_0,Devin Nunes,And what was the nature of his concerns?,02:12:28,Volker/Morrison
691,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"Well, I think the easiest way to say it is he was concerned with respect to, for example, the Ukraine trip, that he did not go. He asked me why. It was my practice to have a number of the conversations with Ambassador Taylor one-on-one, and there were certain other matters.",02:12:32,Volker/Morrison
692,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. And did ever get the sense that you resolved his concerns, or did they linger?",02:12:55,Volker/Morrison
693,Section_0,Tim Morrison,"I explained to him my thinking, and that was that.",02:13:03,Volker/Morrison
694,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. Before my time expires, Ambassador Volker, I want to turn quickly to what Ambassador Taylor describes as the irregular channel. He was a participant with you, and Ambassador Sondland hundreds of text messages, correct?",02:13:08,Volker/Morrison
695,Section_0,Kurt Volker,Correct.,02:13:31,Volker/Morrison
696,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Did he ever raise concerns, about what was going on during the time period of the early August time period?",02:13:33,Volker/Morrison
697,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Only as you saw reflected in the text messages themselves, where he said, “Is this now a linkage, or are we doing this?” He had a concern about, just in general, Rudy Giuliani, which I think a lot of us had, but the issue is what do you do about it, about the role that he’s playing. As you note, we were in frequent contact, near daily contact throughout this entire period.",02:13:44,Volker/Morrison
698,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Did he ever engage you in a one-on-one telephone call, to articulate his concerns?",02:14:14,Volker/Morrison
699,Section_0,Kurt Volker,We were on many one-on-one telephone calls. He did not raise those concerns that way. No.,02:14:19,Volker/Morrison
700,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Okay. You’re a experienced diplomat, at one point in time Senate confirmed, Ambassador Sondland is the Ambassador to the European Union, secretary Perry is a Secretary of energy. Certainly not… Doesn’t sound like an irregular bunch. Did he ever articulate to you that he thought the three of you working on Ukraine policy was a problem?",02:14:23,Volker/Morrison
701,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"No, he did not.",02:14:54,Volker/Morrison
702,Section_0,Devin Nunes,"Were you surprised during his testimony, when he came in for the deposition, when he established these two tracks, that one was a regular channel that he was in charge of, and the other was a irregular channel?",02:14:55,Volker/Morrison
703,Section_0,Kurt Volker,"Yes, and I don’t agree with his characterization of that, because I had been in my role for a couple of years. I had been the lead on U.S. Ukraine negotiations, and negotiating with Russia and the inter agency work, and the work with our allies. We have a Secretary of Energy, who is a cabinet official, and I think having support from various U.S. Officials for our strengthening, our engagement with Ukraine, I viewed as a very positive thing. If the concern is not us so much, then, because we’re all U.S. officials, but Mayor Giuliani, I don’t view that as a channel at all, because he’s not a representative of the U.S. government, he’s a private citizen. I viewed him as perhaps a useful barometer, in understanding what may be helpful communication from the Ukrainian government, but not someone in a position to represent the U.S. government at all.",02:15:07,Volker/Morrison
704,Section_0,Devin Nunes,Okay. Thank you.,02:16:02,Volker/Morrison
705,Section_0,Adam Schiff,Okay. Why don’t we take a five or 10 minute break? If I could ask the audience to allow the witnesses to leave the room first. We are in recess.,02:16:05,Volker/Morrison
706,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"We’re now going to proceed to a 15 minute round by either chair in majority or ranking member of minority. Mr Goldman, you’re recognized for 15 minutes.",00:00,Volker/Morrison
707,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Thank you, Mr chairman. Ambassador Volker, I do want to just correct the record from the first round. You were right to point out, you asked if a quote that I represented you made in the deposition was your words. And I actually read the wrong part in the quote. What you actually said was, it creates a problem again where all of the things that we’re trying to do to advance the bilateral relationship, strengthen our support for Ukraine, strengthen the positioning against Russia, is now getting sucked into a domestic political debate in the US domestic political narrative that overshadows that. So you were right to point that out, and I apologize for the mistake. I want to go back to a couple of things that you said during the minorities round. Can you repeat again with the readout that you got of the July 25th call?",00:11,Volker/Morrison
708,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes. I received a readout from both Ukrainian colleague, Andrey Yermak, as well as from a US person. I don’t now remember whether it was my staffer or someone from the embassy or where. And the readout was that it was a good phone call. That it was a congratulatory phone call for the President’s win in the parliamentary election. That Presidents Zelensky did reiterate his commitment to fighting corruption and advancing reform in Ukraine. And that President Trump renewed his invitation for President Zelensky to come to the White House.",01:06,Volker/Morrison
709,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Okay. And I believe you said that readout was exactly as you expected the call to go. Is that right?,01:38,Volker/Morrison
710,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Exactly. That’s what we were trying to tee up.,01:45,Volker/Morrison
711,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay. I just want to show you once again the July 25th text that you wrote to Andrey Yermak, which was the message that you were relaying to him, so that he could prepare President Zelensky. And you’ll recall this, right, where you said, that this was the message. Good lunch. Thanks. Heard from White House. Assuming President Z convinces Trump, he will investigate quote, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. That’s what you expected from the call, right?",01:47,Volker/Morrison
712,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah, I expected that President Zelensky would be convincing in his statements and comments with President Trump. That he was exactly that, that he would investigate, get to the bottom of things that had happened in 2016. And that if he was strong and conveying who he is as a person and doing that, that President Trump would be convinced and renew the invitation to the White House.",02:21,Volker/Morrison
713,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Right. But you don’t mention corruption in this text, do you?",02:44,Volker/Morrison
714,Section_1,Kurt Volker,This is… I paraphrase-,02:49,Volker/Morrison
715,Section_1,Dan Goldman,The word corruption is not in this text.,02:52,Volker/Morrison
716,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"The word corruption is not there. Investigating things that have happened in the past that would be corrupt, would be investigating corruption.",02:53,Volker/Morrison
717,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"You say a couple of times in your opening statement, and you just said it again. That is, investigating things that happened in the past. You are aware of course that most investigations relate to things that happened in the past, right? Sorry?",03:00,Volker/Morrison
718,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,03:12,Volker/Morrison
719,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay, so that doesn’t really move the needle, whether it’s current or past, in terms of the subject of the investigation, right?",03:13,Volker/Morrison
720,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah, the subject of the investigation are things that happened in the past.",03:20,Volker/Morrison
721,Section_1,Dan Goldman,You also talked a little bit about the meeting that you had on July 26th with Presidents Zelensky and Ambassador Sondland in Kiev. Is that right?,03:22,Volker/Morrison
722,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"On the 26th, we had a meeting with President Zelensky, yes.",03:33,Volker/Morrison
723,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And I believe you testified that the topic of investigations did not come up at all, is that right?",03:40,Volker/Morrison
724,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah, I don’t recall them coming up. Just the general phone call.",03:46,Volker/Morrison
725,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"You didn’t take notes of that call, of that meeting, right?",03:49,Volker/Morrison
726,Section_1,Kurt Volker,No I did not.,03:52,Volker/Morrison
727,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Right because you had, there were staffers there to do that?",03:52,Volker/Morrison
728,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,03:55,Volker/Morrison
729,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And so if there are two staffers who took notes of that meeting and testified that the subject of either sensitive topics or investigations came up, are we better off taking their word for it than yours?",03:56,Volker/Morrison
730,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I have no reason to doubt their notes if they were notes taken contemporaneously at the meeting.,04:09,Volker/Morrison
731,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay. Another witness testified before us, Laura Cooper, about a meeting that she had with you on August 20th. Do you recall having that meeting with her? Because you didn’t mention it in your deposition?",04:13,Volker/Morrison
732,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes I did. I did mention that I had been making the rounds to weigh in on lifting the hold on security assistance. To do that with all of the inter agency players.,04:29,Volker/Morrison
733,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And she recalled with some specificity that meeting, which I believe was also based on her notes, that you described the statement that you were trying to get President Zelensky to make to, and I’ll quote what she said, disavow interference in US elections, and commit to the prosecution of individuals involved in election interference. And if he were to agree to do that, she testified, then you thought that it might help to lift the hold on security assistance. Is that your recollection of the conversation as well?",04:42,Volker/Morrison
734,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Not exactly.,05:14,Volker/Morrison
735,Section_1,Dan Goldman,So how does yours differ?,05:15,Volker/Morrison
736,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I recall talking about the statement that we had discussed earlier, the one that had been in the subject of these exchanges between Mr. Yermak and myself. Myself, Ambassador Sondland and Rudy Giuliani. And then back to Yermak. So I discussed that this is an effort we are doing. That this could be helpful in getting a reset of the thinking of the President, the negative view of Ukraine that he had. And if we did that, I thought that would also be helpful, in unblocking whatever hold there was on security assistance. And if there’s this negative presumption about Ukraine, getting this stuff on track would be helpful.",05:17,Volker/Morrison
737,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"All right, well so that’s a different interpretation. But you don’t doubt that what she testified is inaccurate, do you?",05:55,Volker/Morrison
738,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I believe she accurately reflected what she understood from the conversation.,06:02,Volker/Morrison
739,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay. You testified a little bit about the June 28th conference call that you had with Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor. I’m not sure if Deputy Secretary Kent was on the line.",06:06,Volker/Morrison
740,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I don’t believe so.,06:19,Volker/Morrison
741,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And Secretary Perry, before you looped in President Zelensky. Am I right about the participants of that? Or was Secretary Perry not on it?",06:20,Volker/Morrison
742,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah, I am pretty sure that Deputy Assistant Secretary kent was not on it. I don’t remember whether Secretary Perry was on it. And I don’t remember whether I stayed on for Presidents Zelensky joining the call or not.",06:29,Volker/Morrison
743,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Okay.,06:42,Volker/Morrison
744,Section_1,Kurt Volker,There were two separate calls or the same call.,06:42,Volker/Morrison
745,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Were there any staff members or note takers on the call?,06:44,Volker/Morrison
746,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I don’t believe so.,06:47,Volker/Morrison
747,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Why?,06:48,Volker/Morrison
748,Section_1,Kurt Volker,We were having a call among ourselves to talk about what were the messages we thought we needed to convey.,06:50,Volker/Morrison
749,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And at that point we’ve had other testimony from people who did take notes, that there was a discussion about the investigations, or what you needed to do, what President Zelensky needed to do, in order to get the White House meeting? Do you recall that?",06:57,Volker/Morrison
750,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I recall seeing that in Ambassador Taylor’s testimony, and I believe there may have even been a text message to that effect. And again, it comes down to what are we talking about in terms of these investigations? Because what I certainly understood is we’re talking about Ukraine looking into and fighting corruption internally. And being convincing about this, presenting the new president and the new team as a change in Ukraine.",07:12,Volker/Morrison
751,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Well, you understood that the investigations were Burisma and the 2016 election, right?",07:36,Volker/Morrison
752,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,07:42,Volker/Morrison
753,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Okay. And you interpreted those to be… You interpreted those to be okay because in theory they were looking into Ukrainians?,07:42,Volker/Morrison
754,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,07:51,Volker/Morrison
755,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay. But we can agree, can we not, that the investigations, all the investigations that we’re talking about here today were Burisma and the 2016 election?",07:51,Volker/Morrison
756,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,08:01,Volker/Morrison
757,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay. Now, and what you then amended your testimony today to say, is that in retrospect, if you did not realize that the purpose for Mr. Giuliani and President Trump to want the Burisma investigation was for political benefits in digging up dirt or getting some information on Vice President Biden. That’s what you learned subsequently, right?",08:01,Volker/Morrison
758,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"It’s correct that I learned about the President’s interest in investigating Vice President Biden from the phone call transcript, which came much, much later. From Giuliani, I didn’t know that he was actively pursuing this. I did know that he raised this with me directly, and I had pushed back on it.",08:25,Volker/Morrison
759,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Well, you knew that Ambassador Sondland was pursuing this at the July 10th meeting when he raised these investigations himself.",08:43,Volker/Morrison
760,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Again, he didn’t specify Biden. He didn’t specify Burisma as I recall either. I understood it to be a generic comment. And something again, not appropriate for that meeting.",08:50,Volker/Morrison
761,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Right, I understand. But Biden wasn’t mentioned, but you do agree that when investigations are referenced in this context, it is Burisma and the 2016 election, no?",09:00,Volker/Morrison
762,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, that’s what I understand.",09:12,Volker/Morrison
763,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Right. And on that July 10th call, when Ambassador Sondland raised the investigations, he did that in response to a question from the Ukrainians about the White House meeting. Isn’t that right?",09:14,Volker/Morrison
764,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Can you repeat the question? I didn’t catch that.,09:26,Volker/Morrison
765,Section_1,Dan Goldman,You said that Ambassador Sondland mentioned a specific investigations at the July 10th meeting in Ambassador Bolton’s office. And you said that you thought that was inappropriate.,09:29,Volker/Morrison
766,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,09:39,Volker/Morrison
767,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Didn’t he make that comment in response to a question from the Ukrainian officials about when they could schedule the White House meeting?,09:40,Volker/Morrison
768,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"That I’m not sure about. I remember the meeting essentially already being over, and then Ambassador Sondland bringing that up.",09:50,Volker/Morrison
769,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And in the July 2nd or third meeting in Toronto that you had with Presidents Zelensky, you also mentioned investigations to him, right?",09:58,Volker/Morrison
770,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,10:07,Volker/Morrison
771,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And again, you were referring to the Burisma and the 2016-",10:07,Volker/Morrison
772,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I was thinking of Burisma in 2016.,10:09,Volker/Morrison
773,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay. And you understood that that’s what the Ukrainians interpreted, references to investigations to be related to Burisma and the 2016 election?",10:11,Volker/Morrison
774,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I don’t know specifically that time if we had talked to that specifically Burisma 2016 with President Zelensky. That was my assumption though, that they would have been thinking that too.",10:20,Volker/Morrison
775,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Now, Mr. Morrison, when did you have that conversation with Fiona Hill about Burisma and the parallel track involving Ambassador… Parallel process rather involving Ambassador Sondland and Rudy Giuliani. Do you recall?",10:31,Volker/Morrison
776,Section_1,Tim Morrison,We had a number of handoff discussions between one July and 15 July.,10:47,Volker/Morrison
777,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay. So in that period of time, you were certainly aware of this effort to promote this Burisma investigation that Ambassador Sondland and Rudy Giuliani were going about, or at least you had heard about it from Dr. Hill?",10:51,Volker/Morrison
778,Section_1,Tim Morrison,I had heard about it from Dr. Hill.,11:09,Volker/Morrison
779,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay. I want to pull up another excerpt from a recent Wall Street Journal article that quotes an email, from July 13th, that Ambassador Sondland sent to you. And he wrote to you, quote, “Sole purpose is for Zelensky to give POTUS assurances of new sheriff in town. Corruption ending, unbundling moving forward. And any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently.” And you responded, “Tracking.” What did you understand Ambassador Sondland to mean when he wrote to you “any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently”?",11:11,Volker/Morrison
780,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I don’t know that I had any understanding. These are emails? July 13 emails. I wasn’t even in the seat yet. But I knew that among the head of state meetings we were attempting to schedule, was one between the President and President Zelensky.",11:53,Volker/Morrison
781,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Right. But it was before this that Dr. Hill had told you about Burisma and Ambassador Sondland in particular, his desire for this parallel process to investigate Burisma, right?",12:11,Volker/Morrison
782,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes.,12:22,Volker/Morrison
783,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"So you had that association when you received his email, asking you about investigations, correct?",12:22,Volker/Morrison
784,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Not necessarily.,12:29,Volker/Morrison
785,Section_1,Dan Goldman,No?,12:31,Volker/Morrison
786,Section_1,Tim Morrison,No.,12:32,Volker/Morrison
787,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Why not?,12:32,Volker/Morrison
788,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Because among the discussions I had with Dr. Hill were about Ambassador Sondland. I think she might’ve coined it the Gordon problem. And I decided to keep track of what Ambassador Sondland was doing. I didn’t necessarily always act on things Gordon suggested, that he believed were important. So he wanted to get a meeting. I understood that the President wanted to do, and had agreed to a meeting. And so I was tracking that we needed to schedule a meeting.",12:35,Volker/Morrison
789,Section_1,Dan Goldman,You were not endorsing the notion of President Zelensky’s sending a message about investigations. Is that your testimony?,13:16,Volker/Morrison
790,Section_1,Tim Morrison,That is my testimony.,13:23,Volker/Morrison
791,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Okay. Ambassador Volker, I’m going to jump ahead. After the aid was released, you went to the Yes conference, right, in Ukraine? And are you aware that Ambassador Taylor, who testified based on quite detailed notes, indicated that earlier, a few days before that Ambassador Sondland had told him that President Trump is a businessman. And so before he writes a check, he likes to see people pay up. Something to that effect. You’re aware of that?",13:24,Volker/Morrison
792,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I am familiar with that testimony.,14:08,Volker/Morrison
793,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"And you’re also familiar that Ambassador Taylor said that you said something very similar to him, when you were in Ukraine for the Yes conference. Do you recall saying that to Ambassador Taylor?",14:10,Volker/Morrison
794,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I do. I was repeating what Gordon Sondland had said to me, to explain to Bill Taylor, what that understanding was.",14:20,Volker/Morrison
795,Section_1,Dan Goldman,And in what context did Ambassador Sondland say that to you?,14:29,Volker/Morrison
796,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I think we were talking about the release of the hold on security assistance. And he was saying that the President has, he’s already got a negative view of Ukraine. He sees a check on his desk that’s going to the Ukrainians, not sure about them. So he wants to hold onto it until he’s assured.",14:33,Volker/Morrison
797,Section_1,Dan Goldman,Right. And the pay up before he writes the check is to get the investigations that he wants. Isn’t that right?,14:55,Volker/Morrison
798,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That was not clear to me.,14:59,Volker/Morrison
799,Section_1,Dan Goldman,What did you think it meant?,15:00,Volker/Morrison
800,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I didn’t think that there was a pay up as you say. As we said, the language was similar. I had heard from Gordon that he sees this check, he’s not sure he wants it. He wants to make sure that he’s got a deal with the Ukrainians. I didn’t know specifically other than this, that generic formulation.",15:02,Volker/Morrison
801,Section_1,Dan Goldman,"Mr Chairman, I yield back.",15:18,Volker/Morrison
802,Section_1,Adam Schiff,15 minutes to ranking member Nunes.,15:20,Volker/Morrison
803,Section_1,Devin Nunes,Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Chair. Do you expect any more of these magical 15 minute of devotions that you come up with in the back?,15:23,Volker/Morrison
804,Section_1,Adam Schiff,I don’t know how magical they are. They’re prescribed by House Resolution 660. That we can have successive rounds of up to 45 minutes. So this is part of the prescribed procedure under the House Resolution.,15:33,Volker/Morrison
805,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Do you expect you’re going to have more this evening? Are you, or this is your last-",15:46,Volker/Morrison
806,Section_1,Adam Schiff,I do not expect more will be necessary.,15:50,Volker/Morrison
807,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Thank you gentleman. So for everyone watching, this is another example of how out of control this process has become, where the Democrats just magically give themselves additional minutes. Which they’re right, in the little special rule that they wrote, they can do. But you’d at least think that they’d have the decency to just tell us that you’re going to have 15 minutes more.",15:54,Volker/Morrison
808,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"And I would say that you can go four hours. We can go five hours. We’ll give you all you want. You can keep digging if you want. The deeper the hole you dig, the more viewers will turn off, because people just aren’t buying the drug deal that you guys are trying to sell.",16:18,Volker/Morrison
809,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"I would add that since we are getting into prime time, these are two witnesses that were your witnesses that you called in to depose. We still ask for witnesses that you did not depose, including the whistleblower, who you and others claimed not to know. Which we still need to get to bottom of that, because it is the most important material fact witness, to how this whole mess began in the first place.",16:34,Volker/Morrison
810,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Secondly, we’ve asked for the DNC operatives that were working with Ukrainians to dig up dirt for what you call, or what the left calls conspiracy theories. Which they are right, they are conspiracy theories of dirt that they dug up to spin their own conspiracy theories to attack the Trump campaign in the 2016 election. So I have no more questions for these witnesses. I know our members do. Mr Caster, you have a little bit of a cleanup here.",17:05,Volker/Morrison
811,Section_1,Steve Castor,"Thank you Mr. Nunes. I’ll try to be quick and yield some time back, so we don’t have to use every last minute.",17:33,Volker/Morrison
812,Section_1,Steve Castor,"Ambassador Volker, are you aware of a statement just last week from Foreign Minister Prystaiko? He said that no one ever told the Ukrainians, certainly not him, that there was any linkage between the security assistance funds and investigations.",17:39,Volker/Morrison
813,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I saw that statement, yes.",17:56,Volker/Morrison
814,Section_1,Steve Castor,And do you know of the foreign minister?,17:57,Volker/Morrison
815,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I do.,18:00,Volker/Morrison
816,Section_1,Steve Castor,"And during times of relevant, did you ever have any discussions with him about the investigations and links?",18:01,Volker/Morrison
817,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Not about investigations with him. I believe I kept that discussion to being with Mr. Yermak. And we did discuss with Foreign Minister Prystaiko, and at the time he was diplomatic advisor security assistance, after it was raised, after August 29th. And I did discuss that with him.",18:07,Volker/Morrison
818,Section_1,Steve Castor,The primary person you worked with was Mr. Yermak?,18:26,Volker/Morrison
819,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,18:30,Volker/Morrison
820,Section_1,Steve Castor,And Mr. Yermak also had some meetings with Ambassador Sondland. Did Mr. Yermak ever give you any feedback from his interactions with Ambassadors Sondland?,18:31,Volker/Morrison
821,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I can’t say whether he did or didn’t. We were in frequent contact and we were just talking about the issues as we went along.,18:41,Volker/Morrison
822,Section_1,Steve Castor,The episode at Warsaw where apparently Ambassadors Sondland pulled Mr. Yermak aside. Did Mr. Yermak give you any feedback on that meeting?,18:48,Volker/Morrison
823,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I did not get any things specific after that. This was around I believe September 1st or second. And it was at that time that I had been, I think texted by Mr. Yermak, and was subsequent in touch with him and Prystaiko, where I told them both. And also the Defense Minister. I told them all, don’t worry, we know about this. We were trying to fix it. And I think I left the conversation at that.",19:00,Volker/Morrison
824,Section_1,Steve Castor,"And does the Ukrainian officials, to the best of your knowledge, they trusted you?",19:28,Volker/Morrison
825,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Very much so. We had a very close relationship.,19:31,Volker/Morrison
826,Section_1,Steve Castor,"And so when you made statements like that to them, do you think they believed you?",19:34,Volker/Morrison
827,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I think they believe me. I think they would also have other conversations, and they would hear things from other people. But I also think that they knew I was sincere with them.",19:37,Volker/Morrison
828,Section_1,Steve Castor,And they also trusted Ambassador Taylor?,19:46,Volker/Morrison
829,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,19:48,Volker/Morrison
830,Section_1,Steve Castor,Just like to demystify a little bit of the whole Mayor Giuliani role here. You met with him I believe one time?,19:50,Volker/Morrison
831,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,19:57,Volker/Morrison
832,Section_1,Steve Castor,"And you had some exchange, some text messages with him, correct?",19:58,Volker/Morrison
833,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes. Between, I guess it was the 10th of July and around the 13th of August.",20:02,Volker/Morrison
834,Section_1,Steve Castor,"And during your deposition we did an accounting of your communications with Mr. Giuliani. And it wasn’t that there weren’t that many. We sort of accounted for them all. And then Ambassador Sondland, when he came in, he didn’t have any one-on-one meetings with Mayor Giuliani to your knowledge, is that correct?",20:09,Volker/Morrison
835,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I don’t believe he did, but I don’t know.",20:31,Volker/Morrison
836,Section_1,Steve Castor,"And in fact, I think Ambassador Sondland testified that there were a couple of conference calls that he may have been on with you.",20:33,Volker/Morrison
837,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is true.,20:41,Volker/Morrison
838,Section_1,Steve Castor,Okay. Just getting back to the irregular channel that Ambassador Taylor coined in his deposition testimony. Did you ever have an opportunity to close the loop with him about any concerns whatsoever? Or was it all just these specific instances raised in the texts?,20:42,Volker/Morrison
839,Section_1,Kurt Volker,It’s only those specific instances.,21:08,Volker/Morrison
840,Section_1,Steve Castor,"Do you think Ambassador Taylor and your communications with him believe that Mr. Giuliani was in far greater communication with yourself, Secretary Perry and Ambassador Sondland?",21:10,Volker/Morrison
841,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I don’t know what he thought.,21:21,Volker/Morrison
842,Section_1,Steve Castor,"Okay. I think that’s all I had, Mr. Nunes. Do you?",21:22,Volker/Morrison
843,Section_1,Devin Nunes,I have nothing more. Would the gentleman allow us to use our magic minutes to yield to one of our members who’d like to go?,21:28,Volker/Morrison
844,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"The House rules don’t permit that, Mr. Nunes.",21:34,Volker/Morrison
845,Section_1,Devin Nunes,We yield back.,21:37,Volker/Morrison
846,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"We’ll now go to five minute member questions. I recognize myself for five minutes. Ambassador Volker, I want to ask you about something in your opening statement, with respect to the July 10th meeting. You testify, I participated in the July 10 meeting between National Security Advisor Bolton and then Ukrainian Chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov. As I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a generic comment about investigations. I think all of us thought it was inappropriate. The conversation did not continue, and the meeting concluded.",21:40,Volker/Morrison
847,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador Volker, we asked you about that meeting during your deposition. And you told us nothing about this. I believe we asked you about why the meeting came to an end, and why you had earlier indicated I think to Ambassador Taylor that it did not go well. And your answer was that Danilov was in the weeds on National Security policy. Why didn’t you tell us about this?",22:15,Volker/Morrison
848,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Because that’s what I remembered from the meeting, what I provided in my October 3rd statement. As I said, I’ve learned other things, including seeing the statements from Alex Vindman and from Fiona Hill. And that reminded me that yes, at the very end of that meeting, as it was recounted in Colonel Vindman’s statement, I did remember that. Yes, that’s right. Gordon did bring that up, and that was it.",22:43,Volker/Morrison
849,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"So at the time we depose you, and I think we were there for six, seven or eight hours, and we were asking you specifically about what you knew about these investigations. You didn’t remember that Gordon Sondland had brought this up in the July 10th meeting with Ukrainians, and Ambassador Bolton called an end to the meeting. Ambassador Bolton described that meeting as some drug deal that Sondland and Mulvaney cooked up. You had no recollection of that?",23:08,Volker/Morrison
850,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Right, so in terms of Gordon bringing it up, no, I did not remember that at the time of my October 3rd testimony. I read the account by Alex, and that jogged my memory. I said yes, that’s right. That did happen. I do not, still to this point, recall it being an abrupt end to the meeting. The meeting was essentially over. And we got up, we went out to the little circle in front of the White House. We took a photograph. It did not strike me as abrupt.",23:35,Volker/Morrison
851,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador Volker, you said in your written testimony today, I think all of us thought it was inappropriate. Now, if as you say, Ambassador Sondland only mentioned investigations in the Bolton meeting, and you don’t recall hearing him being more specific, although others have testified that he was in the War room. Why did you think it was inappropriate?",24:02,Volker/Morrison
852,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah I thought it was some… Put it this way, it’s something of an eye roll moment, where you have a meeting, you’re trying to advance the substance of the bilateral relationship. We have the head of the National Security and Defense Council. It was a disappointing meeting because I don’t think that the Ukrainians got as much out of that in terms of their presentation as they could have. And then this comes up at the very end of the meeting. It’s like, this is not what we should be talking about.",24:28,Volker/Morrison
853,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"But Ambassador, you’ve said that you think it was appropriate to ask the Ukrainians to do investigations of 2016 and Burisma, as long as Burisma didn’t mean the Bidens. Something you have now I think, understand you should have seen otherwise. But nonetheless, if it was appropriate, why are you saying today that all of us thought it was inappropriate?",24:56,Volker/Morrison
854,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah, because it was not the place or the time to bring up that. This was a meeting between the National Security Advisor and the Chairman of the National Security Defense Council. First high level meeting we’re having between Ukraine and the United States after President Zelensky’s election.",25:18,Volker/Morrison
855,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Is part of the reason it was inappropriate also that it was brought up in the context of trying to get the White House meeting?,25:35,Volker/Morrison
856,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Possibly, although I don’t recall that being… I know this was the counsel’s question. I don’t remember the exact context of when that came up. I viewed the meeting as essentially having ended.",25:43,Volker/Morrison
857,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"I think you said in your updated testimony that you do think it’s inappropriate and objectionable to seek, to get a foreign government to investigate a political rival. Am I right?",25:55,Volker/Morrison
858,Section_1,Kurt Volker,To investigate the Vice President of the United States or someone who was a US official. I don’t think we should be asking foreign governments to do that. I would also say that’s true of a political rival.,26:10,Volker/Morrison
859,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And you recognized when you got the call record, when you finally did see the call record, that’s what took place in that call, correct?",26:21,Volker/Morrison
860,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,26:28,Volker/Morrison
861,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Morrison, Ambassador Volker thinks it’s inappropriate to ask a foreign head of state to investigate a US person, let alone a political rival. But you said you had no concern with that. Do you think that’s appropriate?",26:29,Volker/Morrison
862,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"As a hypothetical matter, I do not.",26:45,Volker/Morrison
863,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Well, I’m not talking about a hypothetical matter. Read the transcript. In that transcript, does the President not ask Zelensky to look into the Bidens?",26:48,Volker/Morrison
864,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Mr. Chairman, I can only tell you what I was thinking at the time. That is not what I understood the President to be doing.",26:59,Volker/Morrison
865,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"But nonetheless, this was the first and only time where you went from listening to a presidential call directly to the national security lawyers, is it not?",27:06,Volker/Morrison
866,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, that’s correct.",27:17,Volker/Morrison
867,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And I think you’ve said that your concern was not that it was unlawful, but that it might leak. Is that right?",27:18,Volker/Morrison
868,Section_1,Tim Morrison,That is correct.,27:25,Volker/Morrison
869,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Now the problem with the leaking is that what would be leaking is a President asking a foreign head of state to investigate Mr. Biden? Isn’t that the problem?,27:26,Volker/Morrison
870,Section_1,Tim Morrison,I believe I stated I had three concerns about what the impact of a call leaking might be.,27:39,Volker/Morrison
871,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"If it was a perfect call, would you have had a concern of it leaking?",27:45,Volker/Morrison
872,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No. Well, no, I would still have a concern about it leaking.",27:48,Volker/Morrison
873,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Okay. And would you have thought it was appropriate if President Trump had asked Zelensky to investigate John Kasich, or to investigate Nancy Pelosi, or to investigate Ambassador Volker? That’d be appropriate?",27:51,Volker/Morrison
874,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"In those hypothetical cases, no. Not appropriate.",28:14,Volker/Morrison
875,Section_1,Adam Schiff,But you’re not sure about Joe Biden?,28:18,Volker/Morrison
876,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, again, I can always speak to what I understood at the time. And why I acted the way I did at the time.",28:21,Volker/Morrison
877,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Finally, my colleagues asked about, well, doesn’t aid get held up for all kinds of reasons? Ambassador Volker, have you ever seen military aid held up because a President wanted his rival investigated?",28:35,Volker/Morrison
878,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, I have not seen that.",28:49,Volker/Morrison
879,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"You ever seen that, Mr. Williams? Mr. Morrison, I’m sorry?",28:51,Volker/Morrison
880,Section_1,Tim Morrison,No Chairman.,28:55,Volker/Morrison
881,Section_1,Adam Schiff,I yield to the ranking member.,28:57,Volker/Morrison
882,Section_1,Devin Nunes,So you took two additional minutes. Are you giving our side seven minutes?,28:59,Volker/Morrison
883,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Of course.,29:03,Volker/Morrison
884,Section_1,Devin Nunes,I recognize Mr. Turner.,29:04,Volker/Morrison
885,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Thank you. Ambassador Volker. Mr. Morrison. Good to see you again. I appreciate your service to your country and your service in government. Our country is safer today because of the work of both of you men. I want you to know that during all the testimony that we’ve had, no one has ever alleged that either of you have done anything inappropriate or improper. And everyone has spoken of both of you as having a high level of professionalism, and a high degree of ethical standards. Ambassador Volker, I appreciated in your opening statement, your comments of your work to focus on Russia as an invasion of Ukraine and occupation, and your work on legal defensive arms. That would include the Javelins would it not, Ambassador Volker?",29:08,Volker/Morrison
886,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, that’s right.",29:50,Volker/Morrison
887,Section_1,Michael Turner,"And that made a big difference to the Ukrainians, did it not?",29:51,Volker/Morrison
888,Section_1,Kurt Volker,A very big difference.,29:51,Volker/Morrison
889,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Mr. Morrison, tell us about your military service.",29:54,Volker/Morrison
890,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Mr. Turner, I’m a US Naval…",30:00,Volker/Morrison
891,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Mr. Turner. I’m a US Naval Reserve Officer. I’m an intelligence officer.,30:03,Volker/Morrison
892,Section_1,Michael Turner,Where did you go to law school?,30:08,Volker/Morrison
893,Section_1,Tim Morrison,George Washington University.,30:10,Volker/Morrison
894,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Now gentlemen, there’s been a lot of talk about a lot of people, and we’re going to pick up the pace here, because these are short periods of time that we have now for this portions of questions. A lot of people talking about their perceptions, their beliefs, their feelings even, what they heard and their understandings and their thoughts. Ambassador Taylor, Mr. Kent, Ambassador Yovanovitch, and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman all had conversations with each other, and with other people and all had a whole bunch of hearsay. But I can assure you this boils down to just one thing. This is an impeachment inquiry concerning the president of the United States.",30:13,Volker/Morrison
895,Section_1,Michael Turner,"So the only thing that matters besides all these people talking to each other and all their feelings and all of their thoughts and understandings, it really only comes down to what did the President of the United States intend, and what did he say and what did the Ukrainians understand or hear? Ambassador Volker, you’re one of the first people that we’ve had in these open public testimony that’s had conversations with both. So I get to ask you, you had a meeting with the President of United States, and you believe that the policy issues that he raised concerning Ukraine were valid, correct?",30:46,Volker/Morrison
896,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,31:17,Volker/Morrison
897,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Did the President of United States ever say to you that he was not going to allow aid from the United States to go to the Ukraine unless there were investigations into Burisma, the Bidens or the 2016 elections?",31:17,Volker/Morrison
898,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, he did not.",31:30,Volker/Morrison
899,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Did the Ukrainians ever tell you that they understood that they would not get a meeting with the President of the United States, a phone call with the President of United States, military aid or foreign aid from the United States unless they undertook investigations of Burisma, the Bidens or the 2016 elections?",31:31,Volker/Morrison
900,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, they did not know.",31:49,Volker/Morrison
901,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Pretty much Ambassador Volker, you just took apart their entire case. I mean, if the President of United States does not believe or intend it, and the Ukrainians don’t understand it, and you’re the only one who actually stands in between them. Now I ask if Ambassador Volker, the three amigo thing or whatever that they’re trying to disparage you with, you’re not part of an irregular channel, right, Ambassador Volker, aren’t you the official channel?",31:49,Volker/Morrison
902,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,32:14,Volker/Morrison
903,Section_1,Michael Turner,Explain that. Explain how you’re the official channel and not an irregular channel.,32:15,Volker/Morrison
904,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I was appointed by the Secretary of State, Secretary Tillerson in July of 2017 to be the US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations. That’s a role that’s different from Assistant Secretary of State or different from ambassador in Ukraine. That role is particularly focused on the diplomatic activities surrounding the efforts to reverse Russia’s invasion and occupation of Ukraine. It is Minsk Agreement implementation. It is the Normandy process with France and Germany. It is support from NATO. It is support for sanctions from the European union. It’s the OSCE and the monitoring missions. It is the efforts of individual allies like Poland, like the UK, like Canada that are supporting Ukraine. It is work at a senior level in the inner agency with Secretary of Defense.",32:19,Volker/Morrison
905,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Excellent. Great descriptor. I’m going to cut you off there. Ambassador Volker, you are also one of the few people who had actually spoken to Giuliani, the so called irregular channel. Again, all these other people had feelings and understandings about what Giuliani was doing. Did Giuliani ever tell you that United States aid or a meeting with the President of the United States would not occur for the Ukrainians until they agreed to an investigation of Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 election?",33:06,Volker/Morrison
906,Section_1,Kurt Volker,No. Yeah. Everything I heard from Giuliani I took to be his opinion.,33:35,Volker/Morrison
907,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Excellent. So I would assume then that the Ukrainians never told you that Giuliani had told them that in order to get a meeting with the president, a phone call with the president, military aid or foreign aid from the United States, that they would have to do these investigations.",33:37,Volker/Morrison
908,Section_1,Kurt Volker,No.,33:54,Volker/Morrison
909,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Okay. Mr. Morrison, you testified that you spoke to Ambassador Sondland, and he told you of a conversation that he had with the President of the United States. On page 128 of his testimony, he relates the content of a conversation that he had with the president, and he was asked about it. It’s the only one he relates, and he said, he was asked whether or not there was a quid pro quo. He said, I didn’t frame the question basically to the president that way as a link, I did not frame the question that way. I asked the open ended question, what do you want?",33:55,Volker/Morrison
910,Section_1,Michael Turner,"This is Mr. Sondland in his testimony asking this question to the President of the United States. And this is what he reports that the President of the United States. He said, “I want nothing. I don’t want to give them anything, I don’t want anything from them. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.” That’s what he, and he kept repeating. “No quid pro quo.” Over and over again. Mr. Morrison, do you have any reason to believe that Mr Sondland is not telling the truth as the content of his conversation with the President of the United States?",34:29,Volker/Morrison
911,Section_1,Tim Morrison,No Congressman.,34:57,Volker/Morrison
912,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Now, do either of you have any information or evidence that anyone who has testified before this committee, either in the secret dungeon testimonies that have been released, or in these open testimonies has perjured themselves or his lied to this committee?",34:58,Volker/Morrison
913,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I have no reason to think that.,35:11,Volker/Morrison
914,Section_1,Michael Turner,Mr. Morrison.,35:13,Volker/Morrison
915,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, sir.",35:14,Volker/Morrison
916,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Mr. Morrison, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman reported to you, is that correct?",35:16,Volker/Morrison
917,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"He did, sir.",35:21,Volker/Morrison
918,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Now you have a legal background. He said that he listened to the phone call, phone call which you said you saw nothing that had occurred illegally, and he said that he believed the President of the United States demanded to President Zelensky that these investigations move forward. Do you believe, because he only was telling us his opinion. Do you believe in your opinion that the President of United States demanded that President Zelensky undertake these investigations?",35:22,Volker/Morrison
919,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, sir.",35:48,Volker/Morrison
920,Section_1,Michael Turner,"To both of you, Ukraine is an aspirant to the EU. Ambassador Sondland is the ambassador to the EU. Is the Ukraine in the ambassador’s portfolio? Ambassador Volker?",35:51,Volker/Morrison
921,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes. Also because the EU sanctions on Ukraine are incredibly important.,36:06,Volker/Morrison
922,Section_1,Michael Turner,Mr. Morrison.,36:10,Volker/Morrison
923,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I agree, sir.",36:12,Volker/Morrison
924,Section_1,Michael Turner,I yield back.,36:13,Volker/Morrison
925,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr Himes.,36:17,Volker/Morrison
926,Section_1,Jim Himes,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you gentlemen for your testimony today. President Trump has described his July 25th phone call with President Zelensky as quote perfect, and I think he’s done that on Twitter, not once, not twice, but by my count 11 times. It feels to me like this characterization of perfect is of a piece with the idea that we hear in defense of the president’s request to the Ukrainians, that that’s just normal course of business pursuing anti-corruption, and I’ve been concerned from the start that this is actually not about going after corruption, it is in fact about aiming corruption at the vice president. Mr. Morrison, you listened in on the call in the White House Situation Room. Did you hear the president mention the company CrowdStrike and the server?",36:19,Volker/Morrison
927,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I believe so, yes sir.",37:10,Volker/Morrison
928,Section_1,Jim Himes,Did you hear President Trump mentioned the Bidens?,37:11,Volker/Morrison
929,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes sir.,37:14,Volker/Morrison
930,Section_1,Jim Himes,Did you hear President Trump in the length of that phone call use the word corruption?,37:16,Volker/Morrison
931,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No sir. Well, sir, I don’t believe he did.",37:23,Volker/Morrison
932,Section_1,Jim Himes,Was the request that Ukraine investigate CrowdStrike and the Bidens consistent with what you understood to be official US policy towards combating corruption in Ukraine?,37:32,Volker/Morrison
933,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, it was the first I heard of much of this.",37:45,Volker/Morrison
934,Section_1,Jim Himes,"In fact, in your deposition, you testified that you wanted to stay away from what you described as this quote, bucket of investigations. Why did you want to stay away from those issues?",37:48,Volker/Morrison
935,Section_1,Tim Morrison,That was what I was advised by Dr. Hill.,37:58,Volker/Morrison
936,Section_1,Jim Himes,"You also testified that the president’s call was not, and I’m quoting you here, the full-throated endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda that I was hoping to hear. What did you mean by that?",38:03,Volker/Morrison
937,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, what we, myself, Colonel Vindman, others, what we prepared in the package we provided the president was background on President Zelensky, background on his positions about reforming Ukraine, reforming its institutions, rooting out corruption. We were hoping, we recommended the president very clearly support what President Zelensky had run on and his own election, and what his servant of the people party had run on in its election where it received a majority mandate.",38:14,Volker/Morrison
938,Section_1,Jim Himes,"But that didn’t come up in the call, did it?",38:51,Volker/Morrison
939,Section_1,Tim Morrison,No sir.,38:52,Volker/Morrison
940,Section_1,Jim Himes,Are you aware of any other discussion in which the president actually raised those things with the new Ukrainian president?,38:53,Volker/Morrison
941,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Corruption reform?,39:00,Volker/Morrison
942,Section_1,Jim Himes,Yes.,39:00,Volker/Morrison
943,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, it’s been some time since I refreshed myself on the discussion that took place at the UN General Assembly, so I hesitate to say did he ever raise it, but he did not raise it at the time of the 25 July phone call.",39:02,Volker/Morrison
944,Section_1,Jim Himes,"Okay. Switching gears a little bit, you strike me as a process guy, and it’s nagging at me because you characterized Ambassador Sondland’s linking in whatever way it happened of aid to an investigation as The Gordon Problem. You said it caused you to roll your eyes. Ambassador Volker said in the July 10th meeting thought it was inappropriate. John Bolton characterizes this as the drug deal, so it seems like everybody in the room understands that there’s a huge problem here. My understanding is that it would be normal course of business when you have an ambassador out there going rogue as apparently there was consensus Ambassador Sondland was doing, that either the National Security Advisor, John Bolton, or the Secretary of State might reign them in. Why didn’t that happen?",39:15,Volker/Morrison
945,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I can’t speak to that, but I would generally agree that ambassadors work for the Secretary of State and the president.",40:13,Volker/Morrison
946,Section_1,Jim Himes,"You don’t have any idea, you worked for him, you don’t have any idea why John Bolton would characterize what the ambassador was doing as a drug deal, but not reign him in?",40:21,Volker/Morrison
947,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Ambassadors don’t work for the National Security Advisor sir.,40:31,Volker/Morrison
948,Section_1,Jim Himes,"No, but John Bolton’s National Security Advisor, he presumably spends time with the Secretary of State. I’m just puzzled that everybody in the room is characterizing this as The Gordon Problem or inappropriate or a drug deal. And the Secretary of State does nothing.",40:34,Volker/Morrison
949,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I’m sorry. Was there a question?",40:48,Volker/Morrison
950,Section_1,Jim Himes,"Well, yeah, just, you don’t have any insight into that?",40:49,Volker/Morrison
951,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, sir.",40:52,Volker/Morrison
952,Section_1,Jim Himes,"Ambassador Volker, you testified that you were troubled once you read the record of the president’s July 25th call, you testified quote that asking the president of Ukraine to work together with the attorney general to look into this, you can see as it now has happened, this becomes explosive in our domestic politics. And in your new testimony, you call this unacceptable. What specifically in that call to the Ukraine president do you find unacceptable or troubling?",40:53,Volker/Morrison
953,Section_1,Kurt Volker,It is the reference to Vice President Biden.,41:19,Volker/Morrison
954,Section_1,Jim Himes,Thank you. I yield back the balance my time.,41:23,Volker/Morrison
955,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr Conaway.,41:25,Volker/Morrison
956,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. This morning we heard much about July 25th call in which president asked for a favor, at least in Lieutenant Colonel Denman’s mind, that was equivalent to a demand, an order, a requirement. And yet in the last part of the conversation between the two heads of state, President Trump talks about a prosecutor he’s particularly in favor of, and would like to see stay there. And Zelensky though says, Mr. President, no, since we’ve won the absolute majority in our parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate. Does that, to either one of you, does that sound like a Head of State who’s been cowed or bullied, and is under the thumb of the President of the United States?",41:27,Volker/Morrison
957,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Not at all.,42:09,Volker/Morrison
958,Section_1,Tim Morrison,No sir.,42:09,Volker/Morrison
959,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"All right. The impact of the pause that occurred, the 55 day pause in the lethal assistance, or the security assistance, none of us had really understood exactly what happened during that timeframe. No one knew about it other than internal US folks until late August, and so the Russians would not necessarily have known about it. The potential impact, and I agree with on Russia’s interpretation of our support for Ukraine wasn’t known until those last 14 days, but the impact on the lethal aid that they already had, should Russia had tried to move the line of contact further West with their tanks, would the lethal assistance that we’d already given been available to them to push back on that?",42:10,Volker/Morrison
960,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, it would.",42:52,Volker/Morrison
961,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"Mr. Morrison, comments?",42:52,Volker/Morrison
962,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I agree with that, but I would also add the hold, as I understood it applied to Ukraine security systems, UASI, UASI and FMF, it did not apply to FMS, and the javelins were provided under FMS.",42:55,Volker/Morrison
963,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"Okay. So the most lethal weapon that President Trump provided to the Ukrainians that President Obama and his national policy which he set was available to them, should the Russians have pushed their tanks west. The javelins?",43:10,Volker/Morrison
964,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes sir.,43:25,Volker/Morrison
965,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"Throughout that process, even with the pause, even with all the stuff that was going on?",43:26,Volker/Morrison
966,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes sir.,43:30,Volker/Morrison
967,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"Okay. Associated Press reporting that, Ambassador Volker, you mentioned it earlier, that the Russians in an act of war took two gunships, and a tug, and 24 sailors last November. And yet the Russians have now given the 24 sailors back in September, and the Associated Press is reporting today that the they’ve given the gunboats and the tug back, does that sound like Ukraine is inept at being able to negotiate with the Russians because they’re wounded in some way by our actions?",43:31,Volker/Morrison
968,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, I would not say that the Ukrainians are inept.",44:02,Volker/Morrison
969,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"All right, thank you sir. Mr Chairman, I would like as a personal request, a request at you and or one of your lawyer members on the committee that are lawyers to put into the record the federal statute that provides for the absolute immunity or right to an immunity that you’ve exerted over and over and over. I don’t think it’s there, but if it is in fact a federal statute and or a brief that you can cite, put that into the record so that we all know that, and before you get mad and accuse me of wanting to out the whistleblower, you get upset every time somebody accuses you personally of knowing who the whistleblower is. I get upset every time you, anonymity, excuse me, anonymity every time you accuse me of simply, because I want to know the whistle blower, we want to know what’s going on, that we want to out that interviewer, that’s unfair for you to make that accusation, and I get just as mad.",44:06,Volker/Morrison
970,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"This is about leveling the playing field between our two teams. Your team knows the whistle blower, they have intimate knowledge of who he or she is, the IGIC, ICIG even even mentioned NDCA biases. Your team fully understands that, our team should fully understand that, it is simply leveling the playing field. And I know that you’ve overrun my request for a closed door subpoena. I understand that, but I do think that it’s important that you put into the record the basis on which you continue to assert this absolute right to anonymity. Excuse me, I misspoke earlier. Anonymity by the whistle blower. Also, the speaker on September the 23rd issued a, Dear Colleague, that’s a document that we all use to talk to each other. It’s went to 434 other members of Congress. It was intended to be the truth. It was intended to be straight forward.",44:57,Volker/Morrison
971,Section_1,Mike Conaway,"She says in that Dear Colleague that the whistleblower has by law, is required to testify to the House and the Senate intelligence committees. Now you’re defining the speaker in this regard, understand that’s between you and her, but if she’s correct, and you’re defining the law, if on the other hand she misled us into thinking something that was not true, then I think you need to tell the speaker that she needs to retract that Dear Colleague letter, at least set the record straight is the whistleblower required by law as the speaker said to testify to us or not, and what is this absolute right to anonymity that you question? With that I yield back.",45:49,Volker/Morrison
972,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Time of the gentleman has expired. I’d be happy to enter into the record the whistleblower statute that allows whistleblower to remain anonymous, as well as ranking member Nunes prior comments talking about the importance of anonymity for whistleblowers, and with that I recognize Ms. Sewell.",46:31,Volker/Morrison
973,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Volker, it seems by early July it’s become pretty clear that Mr. Giuliani has become a major problem for the US/Ukraine relations. You previously testified that on July 2nd, you met with the Ukrainian president and his aide in Toronto. Is that right?",46:47,Volker/Morrison
974,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I had a bilateral meeting between the US and Ukrainian delegations, and then a policy meeting with the president and his chief of staff.",47:08,Volker/Morrison
975,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"There you discuss Mr. Giuliani’s quote negative view quote of Ukraine based on a conspiracy theory about the 2016 election, right?",47:15,Volker/Morrison
976,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I conveyed he was repeating a negative narrative about Ukraine based on accusations of the then Prosecutor General Lutsenko.,47:25,Volker/Morrison
977,Section_1,Terri Sewell,Are you saying that you didn’t think that they were negative views?,47:37,Volker/Morrison
978,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, no. That they were negative views.",47:42,Volker/Morrison
979,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"Okay, but that wasn’t your description.",47:44,Volker/Morrison
980,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I’m sorry. I’ve lost the question, if you could repeat.",47:49,Volker/Morrison
981,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"I was trying to get at who said the negative views, that you discussed negative views?",47:51,Volker/Morrison
982,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"So the Prosecutor General of Ukraine was putting out this series of conspiracy theories that I believe were self-serving and inaccurate. Mr Giuliani had repeated these to me, so I believe that he was at least affected by those and believed those and was concerned about those.",47:56,Volker/Morrison
983,Section_1,Terri Sewell,And believed that they were negative?,48:15,Volker/Morrison
984,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Believed that they were negative, and was conveying them to the president.",48:16,Volker/Morrison
985,Section_1,Terri Sewell,So was it problematic that he believed that they were negative views? Was it true?,48:20,Volker/Morrison
986,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, the whole thing was problematic.",48:26,Volker/Morrison
987,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"Ambassador Taylor testify that on July 2nd, you told Ukrainians that they needed to quote cooperate on investigations end quote, you’re now saying that you don’t recall saying those words? Is that correct?",48:29,Volker/Morrison
988,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I don’t believe I said the words cooperate on investigations.,48:41,Volker/Morrison
989,Section_1,Terri Sewell,Did you say investigations?,48:45,Volker/Morrison
990,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I believe I did, yes.",48:47,Volker/Morrison
991,Section_1,Terri Sewell,And what did you mean by investigations?,48:48,Volker/Morrison
992,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I meant Burisma in 2016 was in my mind, but I wanted to keep it general, and that Ukraine in being convincing to Giuliani, and hopefully also to the president that they are serious about fighting corruption would engage in whatever investigations necessary to clean up the country.",48:50,Volker/Morrison
993,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"Now moving to July 10th, Ambassador Volker sent you a text message, you sent a text message to Giuliani, and I think it’s on the screen now. And you said, Mr. Mayor, could we meet for coffee or lunch in the next week or so? I’d like to update you on my conversations about Ukraine. I think we have an opportunity to get what you need. Did you say that? Is that an accurate-",49:09,Volker/Morrison
994,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is an accurate text message.,49:35,Volker/Morrison
995,Section_1,Terri Sewell,And what did you mean by what you need?,49:37,Volker/Morrison
996,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Contact with the actual government of Ukraine, the people who are now representing President Zelensky and his team.",49:38,Volker/Morrison
997,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"Later that day, you and Ambassador Sondland met with Ukraine officials at the White House. We heard from several witnesses that Ambassador Sondland told the Ukraines that they needed to cooperate with the quote unquote investigations in order to get the Oval Office meeting scheduled on the books. Were these investigations a part of the official US policy towards Ukraine?",49:45,Volker/Morrison
998,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"US policy toward Ukraine was about fighting corruption, and Ukraine going after that-",50:11,Volker/Morrison
999,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"But was it specifically about these kinds of investigation, you said the investigation was Burisma-",50:17,Volker/Morrison
1000,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Well, wait.",50:21,Volker/Morrison
1001,Section_1,Terri Sewell,Okay.,50:21,Volker/Morrison
1002,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"In order to fight corruption, you need to conduct investigations. You need to see what Ukrainian citizens have been up to and doing.",50:22,Volker/Morrison
1003,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"But was that the purpose of that, or was it because the president, you knew that, well that the president wanted those investigations to be done as a condition of for them to actually have a meeting in the White House?",50:29,Volker/Morrison
1004,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Well, first off, we have to be clear what we’re talking about in terms of investigations. We’re not talking about Vice President Biden. We’re not talking about some of the-",50:45,Volker/Morrison
1005,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"Well Burisma is not, that has nothing to do with, you’re saying that-",50:53,Volker/Morrison
1006,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I’m saying that whether Ukrainians, within the company of Burisma had acted in a corrupt way, or sought to buy influence, that’s a legitimate thing for Ukraine to investigate. And if Ukraine can make a statement about their intentions on fighting corruption domestically, that is helpful in order to convince President Trump ultimately that this is-",50:56,Volker/Morrison
1007,Section_1,Terri Sewell,"With all due respect Ambassador Volker, we heard from two witnesses this morning that those investigations were not official US policy. Ambassador Volker. I don’t know if you understand what you were getting yourself into, but sitting here today, I trust you understand that pressuring Ukraine to involve itself in US domestic policy is just simply wrong. I yield back to the balance of my time.",51:16,Volker/Morrison
1008,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Turner.,51:44,Volker/Morrison
1009,Section_1,Michael Turner,I yield my time to Jim Jordan.,51:45,Volker/Morrison
1010,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"I thank gentleman. Ambassador Volker, you were the Special Representative to Ukraine, is that right?",51:47,Volker/Morrison
1011,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,51:52,Volker/Morrison
1012,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"And prior to that, in your diplomatic service, you worked at the NSC, you were a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, you were Ambassador to NATO, Senate confirmed Ambassador to NATO in your distinguished diplomatic career. So it may not bother you when you’re referred to as the irregular channel, but it bothers representative Turner, it bothers me. You were the special envoy to Ukraine. And in that role you said in your opening statement, you were the administration’s most outspoken public figure highlighting Russia’s invasion and occupation of Ukraine and calling out Russia’s responsibility in the war. Is that right?",51:53,Volker/Morrison
1013,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,52:25,Volker/Morrison
1014,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"And in that capacity, you strongly advocated for lifting the ban on sale of lethal defensive arms to Ukraine. Is that right?",52:26,Volker/Morrison
1015,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,52:33,Volker/Morrison
1016,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"And President Trump did it, didn’t he?",52:34,Volker/Morrison
1017,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,52:35,Volker/Morrison
1018,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"But in spite of that, President Trump was still skeptical of giving hard earned tax dollars to Ukraine, right?",52:36,Volker/Morrison
1019,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes. You said that in your testimony as well, and the reason he’s skeptical is, let’s be honest, the guy doesn’t like foreign aid, right?",52:42,Volker/Morrison
1020,Section_1,Jim Jordan,That’s one reason. And then Ukraine’s history of corruption is another.,52:48,Volker/Morrison
1021,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"One of the third most corrupt countries on the planet, and Europe isn’t doing enough, and oh, by the way, in the president’s mind, he did think Ukraine was trying to influence the 2016 election, because things happened. The Democrats want to deny it, but when the ambassador from Ukraine here to the United States writes an op ed on August 4th, 2016 criticizing then candidate Trump, that’s certainly trying to influence the election. When Mr. [inaudible 00:53:15], a key minister in their government says all kinds of negative things about candidate Trump, that certainly looks like it’s trying to influence the election and when Mr. Leschenko states in the Financial Times during the campaign, the majority of Ukrainian political figures want Hillary Clinton to win, that probably sticks in a candidates mind. I know we all run campaigns, and when people say bad things about us in the course of the campaign, we don’t necessarily think great things about them. But you were convinced Zelensky was the real deal, right?",52:51,Volker/Morrison
1022,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,53:43,Volker/Morrison
1023,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Because you spent a lot time with the guy. And guess what? When aid was frozen, you knew if you could get these two guys together, it would work out. When aid was frozen, what did you say? You told the Ukrainians don’t worry about it. Well you didn’t say it. You said don’t be alarmed.",53:44,Volker/Morrison
1024,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yeah.,53:58,Volker/Morrison
1025,Section_1,Jim Jordan,Right?,53:58,Volker/Morrison
1026,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,53:59,Volker/Morrison
1027,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"And guess what happened, when aids frozen, and when it’s released, all kinds of interactions between President Zelensky and senior US officials. Right? Starts with a call. Starts with a call with President Trump and President Zelensky. Next day, you meet with President Zelensky in Ukraine. Then we have Ambassador Bolton meeting with him, then we have Vice President Pence meeting with him. Then we have US Senators Johnson and Murphy meeting with him. And guess what? In none of those meetings, not a single one, did security assistance dollars in exchange for an investigation, not once did they come up, did that conversation come up, is that right?",54:01,Volker/Morrison
1028,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,54:44,Volker/Morrison
1029,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Not once. No discussion of aid for investigations, and as you testified, you never believed aid for investigations was ever being talked about either, in any of these conversations.",54:45,Volker/Morrison
1030,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,54:58,Volker/Morrison
1031,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"But what happened in those meetings? They all became convinced of the same thing you knew. They all saw the same darn thing. This guy was the real deal. He is a legitimate reformer, and they all came back. They all came back and told the president, Hey, Mr. President, this guy’s real. Go ahead and release the dollars. Oh, by the way, in that same timeframe, you know what else happened? Their parliament, their newly elected parliament, as Mr. Morrison testified to, stayed up all night to pass the reform measures, to get rid of the prosecutor, to put in the Supreme High Anti-Corruption Court, to get rid of this ability that no one in their Congress, in their parliament could ever be hit with a crime, I mean that’s Unbelievable. All that happens, and they come back and tell President Trump, hey, guess what, time to release the dollars. And he did it, right?",54:59,Volker/Morrison
1032,Section_1,Kurt Volker,The dollars were released.,55:54,Volker/Morrison
1033,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Yeah, you did your job. You did your job, and you got to put up with all this because the Democrats are out to get this president. You did your job, just the way Mr. Turner described, you did your job over all these years. All these years, and the Democrats put you through this. You have served our country well the kind of diplomat we want serving. And here’s one of the saddest things about all this, what the Democrats are putting us through, you two guys who are here telling it straight, you’ve both decided you’re going to step out of government, because of what these guys are doing, and that’s the sad thing. People like ambassador Volker and Tim Morrison who have served our country so well are now stepping out of our government, because of what these guys are doing. And that’s why Mr. Turner got so fired up a few minutes ago, and why I’m so fired up to, because we appreciate what you guys did. I yield back.",55:55,Volker/Morrison
1034,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Carson.,56:46,Volker/Morrison
1035,Section_1,Andre Carson,"Thank you Chairman Schiff. Ambassador Volker, I want to focus on the press statement that President Trump and Rudy Giuliani wanted Ukraine to make announcing investigations to benefit President Trump. On August 9th sir, Ambassador Sondland and you had this exchange, Ambassador Sondlund says, “Morrison ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms.” You reply, “Excellent! How did you sway him?” And Ambassador Sondland says, “Not sure I did. I think potus really wants the deliverable.” The deliverable here was a public announcement that Ukraine was going to conduct investigations into Burisma, and alleged 2016 legend interference by Ukraine. Is that correct, sir?",56:48,Volker/Morrison
1036,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Thank you. I understood the deliverable to be the statement that we have been talking about.,57:37,Volker/Morrison
1037,Section_1,Andre Carson,"On August 13th, you and Ambassador Sondland discussed a draft statement from Ukraine with Mr. Giuliani. Sir, why did you discuss the draft statement with Mr. Giuliani?",57:43,Volker/Morrison
1038,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Because the idea of the statement had come up from Mr. Yermak’s meeting with Mr. Giuliani. Remember that Mr. Yermak asked me to connect him with Mr. Giuliani. I did. They had a meeting, and then they both called me afterwards. Mr. Giuliani said that he thought Ukraine should make a statement about fighting corruption. Mr Yermak said, and we will say also specifically Burisma in 2016, Mr. Yermak provided me a draft statement, and I wanted to be assured that this statement would actually correct the perception that Mr. Giuliani had of Ukraine, and what they stand for now, so that that would also be conveyed to President Trump and solve this problem that I had observed with our May 23rd meeting with the president. The problem being, that he’s getting a bad set of information, statement like this could potentially correct that.",57:52,Volker/Morrison
1039,Section_1,Andre Carson,So was Mr. Giuliani satisfied with this statement?,58:45,Volker/Morrison
1040,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, he was not.",58:47,Volker/Morrison
1041,Section_1,Andre Carson,Why not?,58:48,Volker/Morrison
1042,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"He believed that it needed to say Burisma and 2016 specifically, or else it would not be credible, would not mean anything new.",58:49,Volker/Morrison
1043,Section_1,Andre Carson,"So in fact, Mr. Giuliani wanted a statement that referenced Burisma and the 2016 elections explicitly, one that would benefit essentially President Trump. Mr Ambassador, here’s the text you sent to the Ukrainian official on August 13th, let’s put that up on the screen. You said, “Hi Andrey. Good talking. Following is the text with an insert at the end for the two key items.” Mr. Ambassador, those two key items were specific references to investigations of Burisma, and the 2016 elections. Isn’t that right, sir?",58:59,Volker/Morrison
1044,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,59:38,Volker/Morrison
1045,Section_1,Andre Carson,"Did Mr. Giuliani, sir, dictate those two key items to you, sir?",59:39,Volker/Morrison
1046,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Well, as you see, I had just had a conversation with Mr. Yarmak to describe to him the conversation that we had just had with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani said that it would need to include these things for it to be convincing to him. I put them in, so we understood what he was talking about, and I shared it with Andre to say, this is what he is talking about.",59:43,Volker/Morrison
1047,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"… shared it with André to say, this is what he is talking about.",01:00:03,Volker/Morrison
1048,Section_1,Andre Carson,And you included them in the proposal to the Ukrainians?,01:00:04,Volker/Morrison
1049,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I put it back in, just be clear to the Ukrainians, this is what the conversation was.",01:00:07,Volker/Morrison
1050,Section_1,Andre Carson,"Mr. Ambassador, if you believe the statement that Mr. Giuliani dictated in August was not a good idea, sir, why were the Ukrainians still considering giving an interview with the same themes in September?",01:00:13,Volker/Morrison
1051,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Well, if I may, Congressman, I conveyed this to the Ukrainians in order to be clear, so we knew what the conversation was about. This was following up on this prior conversation. The Ukrainians then said they had reasons not to do that, and they described those reasons. And I agreed with them, and we agreed to just scrap the statement.",01:00:26,Volker/Morrison
1052,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"From that point on, I didn’t have any further conversations about this statement, so I don’t know how it came up or why it came up that there would be a possibility of President Zelensky doing an interview with US media later saying something like this. And in the end, he didn’t do that either.",01:00:48,Volker/Morrison
1053,Section_1,Andre Carson,"Thank you, sir. Mr. Morrison, you said that the president’s requests during the July 25th call were not consistent with US policy. I emphatically agree with you, sir. Yet these text messages show that Ambassador Volker spent much of August pressing Ukraine to meet those requests. We can only be grateful, I guess, if the president essentially got caught and Congress passed a law to ensure the funding was released in Ukraine before it was too late. I thank you both for your service. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.",01:01:06,Volker/Morrison
1054,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Dr. Wenstrup.,01:01:37,Volker/Morrison
1055,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Okay, gentlemen, thank you very much for being here. I want to start, if I can, with you, Mr. Morrison. In discussing the 7/25 phone call and the concerns that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman had, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman came to you with edits for the transcript. And you stated that you accepted all of his edits. Is that correct?",01:01:41,Volker/Morrison
1056,Section_1,Tim Morrison,I would have accepted all of the edits that I believed were faithful to what was actually discussed.,01:02:07,Volker/Morrison
1057,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,Did he come to you with an edit that said that the word “demand” should be in there?,01:02:13,Volker/Morrison
1058,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I don’t recall that specifically, sir, no.",01:02:19,Volker/Morrison
1059,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,He didn’t either. How soon after the phone call did he meet with you on that particular issue?,01:02:20,Volker/Morrison
1060,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"We got the draft, as was normal, fairly quickly after the call, that same day.",01:02:27,Volker/Morrison
1061,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"That same day. So today, he said, “I reported my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg. It is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a US citizen and political opponent.” Now, he was going to Mr. Eisenberg with his concerns about the conversation, yet he did not, at any point on the edits, say that there should be a demand. And he didn’t do that, but he did say that he didn’t come to you with his concerns because you weren’t available. But that same day, he came to you with edits. Is that correct?",01:02:34,Volker/Morrison
1062,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I believe that’s generally correct, yes, sir.",01:03:15,Volker/Morrison
1063,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"Okay. Well, he said you weren’t available, and you didn’t hear the president make a demand, did you?",01:03:15,Volker/Morrison
1064,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, sir.",01:03:22,Volker/Morrison
1065,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"So sometime between the call and today, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman must’ve been hearing some voices, and he heard “demand” at the time. But he didn’t hear it that day, and he didn’t make it an issue that day. But today, he does. I think that’s pretty bizarre. When Lieutenant Colonel Vindman went to legal, Mr. Eisenberg, do you know if he was advised not to speak to you?",01:03:23,Volker/Morrison
1066,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I don’t have any firsthand knowledge of that, no, sir.",01:03:51,Volker/Morrison
1067,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,Do you know if he was advised to contact the IGIC?,01:03:54,Volker/Morrison
1068,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, sir. I have no firsthand knowledge of that.",01:03:59,Volker/Morrison
1069,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,So you don’t know what he was advised when he went to legal?,01:04:01,Volker/Morrison
1070,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, sir. I do not.",01:04:04,Volker/Morrison
1071,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"Thank you. I appreciate that. Mr. Volker, I want to tell you, I’ve really enjoyed your opening testimony today, taking us through that. I know it was kind of long, but I thought it was extremely well done. And I appreciate it. You talk about letter signed and sharing concerns about leadership in your assigned country, about agreeing with and sometimes disagreeing with the leadership of your own country when you felt it was appropriate. You’re the boots on the ground for the administration. Let’s face it. You’re part of that team that is there to serve the country in that way. And that all to me sounded like the works of a very good diplomat, and I want to thank you for that.",01:04:05,Volker/Morrison
1072,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Thank you, sir.",01:04:43,Volker/Morrison
1073,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"It’s truly appreciated. And corruption was a concern, legitimately, in Ukraine and in many ways. And Mr. Jordan pointed out some of the things that were done by Ukrainians in plain sight … I might use that term, “in plain sight” … by putting op-eds in our newspapers. And it’s certainly more than one country can be trying to influence our elections. Would you agree with that?",01:04:43,Volker/Morrison
1074,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I agree with that.,01:05:10,Volker/Morrison
1075,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"And we keep hearing that that whole thing about Ukrainians, that’s all been debunked. It was just the Russians. Well, that comes from an IC community that some of the people that have come up with those conclusions are some of the very same people that we’re going to find out, if we haven’t already, were deeply involved with this whole Russian collusion hoax.",01:05:12,Volker/Morrison
1076,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"But I want to say you did a great job. You vetted Zelensky’s intentions, what he intended to be as a president. Would you say that’s accurate?",01:05:32,Volker/Morrison
1077,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, that was, in fact, one of the key objectives of the presidential delegation at the inauguration, to take our own judgment and report back to the president.",01:05:41,Volker/Morrison
1078,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"And that’s what your job should be, and you became comfortable with this president, correct?",01:05:48,Volker/Morrison
1079,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I did.",01:05:52,Volker/Morrison
1080,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,And you work to assure our president that you comfortable with this president.,01:05:53,Volker/Morrison
1081,Section_1,Kurt Volker,[crosstalk 01:05:58].,01:05:58,Volker/Morrison
1082,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,Is that correct?,01:05:58,Volker/Morrison
1083,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:05:59,Volker/Morrison
1084,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"And in some ways, you have to work sometimes through any means available. And that might include working with Rudy Giuliani if it could be helpful to you to get that message and advice to the president. Would that be correct?",01:06:00,Volker/Morrison
1085,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I believe that the messages being conveyed by Mr. Giuliani were a problem because they were at variance with what our official message to the president was and not conveying that positive assessment that we all had. And so I thought it was important to try to step in and fix the problem.,01:06:14,Volker/Morrison
1086,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"And in that, I think, you termed that a useful barometer of where things were.",01:06:33,Volker/Morrison
1087,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:06:37,Volker/Morrison
1088,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,"So those useful barometers, I think, can come in a lot of different fashions, like Dennis Rodman in North Korea or James Taylor in France singing You’ve Got a Friend, if they can help the cause. And in that situation, it’s not illegal. Good job, Ambassador. Thank you very much.",01:06:38,Volker/Morrison
1089,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Thanks.,01:06:52,Volker/Morrison
1090,Section_1,Brad Wenstrup,I yield back.,01:06:52,Volker/Morrison
1091,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Ms. Speier.,01:06:54,Volker/Morrison
1092,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thank you both for your participation here today and for your service. I’m going to take us out some 30,000 feet for a minute and talk about cover-ups. But for the fact that the whistleblower came forward, we wouldn’t know anything about this. But for the fact that the inspector general of the CIA found it to be both urgent and credible, we wouldn’t know anything about it.",01:06:57,Volker/Morrison
1093,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"Mr. Morrison, you said that after you heard the call, you went directly to the attorneys in the National Security Council and recommended that they be limited access, and they were subsequently put into a special server. The White House has not released any documents whatsoever to this committee.",01:07:26,Volker/Morrison
1094,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"So to you, Mr. Volker, thank you. But for the fact that you, as a private citizen with your own personal phone and your text messages with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Sondland and Mr. [Myak 01:08:02] and whomever else, but for those text messages that we’ve been putting up on the screen all day, we would have nothing, nothing. And this cover-up would be complete. That’s something we should think about. Now, on July 19th, you had breakfast with Rudy Giuliani at the Trump Hotel. Correct?",01:07:48,Volker/Morrison
1095,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:08:30,Volker/Morrison
1096,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"And in that conversation, at one point, he brought up Mr. Lutsenko, and you said that whatever Mr. Lutsenko is saying, that’s not credible. Is that correct?",01:08:31,Volker/Morrison
1097,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:08:42,Volker/Morrison
1098,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"And then he brought up Mr. Biden, and I’m going to quote you here. “I’ve known him for a long time. He’s a person of integrity.” To Giuliani, “Simply not credible to me Joe Biden would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money or things for his son or anything like that.”",01:08:43,Volker/Morrison
1099,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"Now, we’ve had many discussions over the last few days about these investigations into Burisma and Biden and the 2016 CrowdStrike server. And you, in that conversation with Mr. Giuliani, basically debunked all of that. Now, at that time, at that breakfast, who else was with you at that breakfast?",01:09:04,Volker/Morrison
1100,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"There was someone that Mr. Giuliani brought along. I later learned that this was Lev Parnas, who we’ve learned a lot about since then.",01:09:29,Volker/Morrison
1101,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"So Mr. Lev Parnas was at that breakfast that Mr. Giuliani had with you, and we now know that Mr. Parnas has since been indicted for foreign campaign contributions to President Trump’s political action committee. Is that correct?",01:09:39,Volker/Morrison
1102,Section_1,Kurt Volker,[inaudible 01:09:56].,01:09:56,Volker/Morrison
1103,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"All right. On May 23rd, you were in that discussion with the president, and at one point, he referred to Zelensky having terrible people around him. Who do you think he was calling terrible people around him?",01:09:57,Volker/Morrison
1104,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"There were two people that came to mind. One of them was a former investigative journalist and later a parliamentarian named Serhiy Leshchenko. Serhiy Leshchenko is someone that, in many of these stories, is seen as bringing forth a black ledger relating to Paul Manafort’s activities in Ukraine. That was one person.",01:10:15,Volker/Morrison
1105,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"The other person I thought it could refer to was the person who was being named as President Zelensky’s chief of presidential administration, Andriy Bohdan. He was known as a lawyer for one of the main oligarchs in Ukraine, Ihor Kolomoyskyi, and there was a lot of controversy at the time about him being appointed to the administration.",01:10:37,Volker/Morrison
1106,Section_1,Jackie Speier,Do you think of them as terrible people?,01:10:58,Volker/Morrison
1107,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I don’t think either one of them is terrible people, no.",01:11:00,Volker/Morrison
1108,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"All right, thank you. Mr. Morrison, earlier in testimony that was elicited from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you indicated that others had represented to you that Colonel Vindman leaked. Do you remember saying that?",01:11:03,Volker/Morrison
1109,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, ma’am.",01:11:20,Volker/Morrison
1110,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"All right. Colonel Vindman, this morning under oath, said that he did not, does not leak. Now, would you therefore want to maybe rearrange your comments about the references you made to Colonel Vindman?",01:11:21,Volker/Morrison
1111,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, ma’am.",01:11:40,Volker/Morrison
1112,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"So even though under oath, he said that he has never leaked, you believe in people who said to you that he may have leaked?",01:11:41,Volker/Morrison
1113,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Ma’am, I didn’t believe or disbelieve them. I’m merely relating what they told me.",01:11:51,Volker/Morrison
1114,Section_1,Jackie Speier,"Well, they told you, and so then you decided to continue to put that forward, even though you had no evidence.",01:11:56,Volker/Morrison
1115,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, ma’am. No, ma’am.",01:12:04,Volker/Morrison
1116,Section_1,Jackie Speier,Thank you. I yield back.,01:12:05,Volker/Morrison
1117,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Ma’am. I’m sorry. Chairman, if I could answer.",01:12:06,Volker/Morrison
1118,Section_1,Adam Schiff,You may respond.,01:12:09,Volker/Morrison
1119,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, ma’am, that’s incorrect. They, Dr. Hill, Mr. Erath, others in the NSC, raised concerns about Alex. Those concerns were noted. I didn’t take them for face value. I treated them as representations of others. I was on alert, but I formed my own judgments. I took no action because of the statements of someone else that I couldn’t independently validate.",01:12:09,Volker/Morrison
1120,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Stewart.,01:12:36,Volker/Morrison
1121,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"Thank you, gentlemen. Welcome to Impeachapalooza 2019, which is the Democratic plan to compel America to impeach president Donald J. Trump through the sheer force of boredom because it’s been a long day, and it turns out impeachment is very boring if you don’t have any compelling or any condemning evidence.",01:12:38,Volker/Morrison
1122,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"Good news and bad news … The good news is I’m going to be very, very brief. We’re going on 10-plus hours of this. I will yield back some of my time. The bad news is, most of my colleagues after me won’t, so we’ve still got some time to go.",01:12:59,Volker/Morrison
1123,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"Ambassador Volker, very quickly, do you think that someone should be immune from investigation of suspected ethical or criminal activity just because they are a candidate for office, even for office of the president of the United States?",01:13:13,Volker/Morrison
1124,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I don’t think anyone should be above the law.,01:13:30,Volker/Morrison
1125,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"Well, of course not. That would be absurd to suggest that, and I was certain that’s how you would answer that question. What if some of these alleged ethical or criminal allegations occurred overseas, that occurred in another country? Would it be improper to seek the host country’s help, such as we do with Interpol or any other law enforcement agency?",01:13:31,Volker/Morrison
1126,Section_1,Kurt Volker,There are channels for doing that for American citizens who may have committed crimes abroad.,01:13:50,Volker/Morrison
1127,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"Okay. And again, to seek the host nation’s, their government’s help is not unusual at all, [crosstalk 01:14:01]?",01:13:55,Volker/Morrison
1128,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"That is correct, and we often have treaties for that.",01:14:01,Volker/Morrison
1129,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"Thank you. Thank you. Again, that’s painfully obvious, and to me, that’s exactly … and the only thing that the president was doing here. Mr. Morrison, I want to refer just briefly to Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s testimony where he described the six people … I believe it was five or six people … that were in the situation room listening to this phone call between the two presidents.",01:14:04,Volker/Morrison
1130,Section_1,Chris Stewart,Colonel Vindman described these individuals as exceptional. He stated that there was no reason to question their integrity or professionalism. This was an exchange that he and I had in the closed-door testimony. Do you agree with the description of these national security staff as exceptional people?,01:14:23,Volker/Morrison
1131,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, they are patriots, yes.",01:14:40,Volker/Morrison
1132,Section_1,Chris Stewart,People of great integrity and professionalism?,01:14:41,Volker/Morrison
1133,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, sir.",01:14:44,Volker/Morrison
1134,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"Do any of these … I’m sorry. Did any of these exceptional individuals, people of unquestioned integrity and professionalism, indicate to you that they had thought that the president of the United States engaged in any illegal or unethical behavior as a result of this phone call?",01:14:45,Volker/Morrison
1135,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Not that I’m aware of, Congressman.",01:15:04,Volker/Morrison
1136,Section_1,Chris Stewart,Did any of them suggest to you in any way that they thought the president was involved with bribery or any such thing associated with that?,01:15:05,Volker/Morrison
1137,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Not that I’m aware of, Congressman.",01:15:13,Volker/Morrison
1138,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"It only leaves two possible explanations. Either these individuals of what we’ve described as great integrity … Either that’s not true, which I don’t believe, or they just interpreted an ambiguous conversation very differently than did Colonel Vindman.",01:15:16,Volker/Morrison
1139,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"And I have one last thing just as an aside. As an Air Force officer, I’ve never understood why President Obama was against providing lethal aid to the Ukraine. Ambassador, do you have some insight into why they refuse to do that?",01:15:31,Volker/Morrison
1140,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I would only point to the statements from the administration at the time. There was a perception that our allies would oppose it, that Germany would oppose it. There was a perception that Germany should be in the lead. There was a perception that it could be provocative to Russia or escalate the conflict. As I’ve said extensively at the time and as special representative, I don’t agree with those arguments. And I believe that the record has borne out that providing those lethal defensive arms was actually very important.",01:15:43,Volker/Morrison
1141,Section_1,Chris Stewart,"I agree with you, Ambassador. I think that you got it right, and I think President Trump got it right. And with that, I yield back.",01:16:10,Volker/Morrison
1142,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Quigley.,01:16:18,Volker/Morrison
1143,Section_1,Mike Quigley,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador, I want to direct your attention to a meeting you had with Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Yermak September 14th in Kiev. Do you recall this meeting, sir?",01:16:20,Volker/Morrison
1144,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I believe we had dinner. It was around the time of the YES conference.,01:16:34,Volker/Morrison
1145,Section_1,Mike Quigley,"Okay. And do you remember discussing with Mr. Yermak Ukraine’s intent to investigate their former president, Mr. Poroshenko?",01:16:37,Volker/Morrison
1146,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I remember raising the issue of the possibility of prosecutions.,01:16:48,Volker/Morrison
1147,Section_1,Mike Quigley,"They brought it up. You raised it, and they talk about their intention.",01:16:52,Volker/Morrison
1148,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I believe … Excuse me, Congressman. I’m sorry. To be clear, there was a lot of talk in Kiev at that time about whether the new team would be prosecuting the former president. And I had met with President Poroshenko. I met with others in the opposition as well. And I wanted to call Mr. Yermak’s attention to the potential problems with this.",01:16:57,Volker/Morrison
1149,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I’m very familiar with other examples of countries in the region that have gone for prosecutions of the former government, and these have created deep divisions in society. And so I cited President Zelensky’s inauguration speech … I’m sorry … his National Day speech from August 24th that was all about unifying the country. And I cautioned Mr. Yermak to say that pursuing of President Poroshenko risks deepening the divisions in the country, exactly the opposite of what President Zelensky has said he wants to do.",01:17:22,Volker/Morrison
1150,Section_1,Mike Quigley,So it’s fair to describe it as you discouraged him from such actions.,01:17:59,Volker/Morrison
1151,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah, I discouraged him. I raised concerns about what the potential impact would be.",01:18:03,Volker/Morrison
1152,Section_1,Mike Quigley,And what was Mr. Yermak’s response?,01:18:08,Volker/Morrison
1153,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I believe, and I’m refreshed in this by seeing the testimony of others.",01:18:11,Volker/Morrison
1154,Section_1,Mike Quigley,Mr. Taylor.,01:18:15,Volker/Morrison
1155,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Mr. Taylor’s testimony.,01:18:16,Volker/Morrison
1156,Section_1,Mike Quigley,Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent.,01:18:17,Volker/Morrison
1157,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Right, and I believe, based on that testimony, that Mr. Yermak said, “Well, what, you mean like asking us to investigate Clinton and Biden?”",01:18:19,Volker/Morrison
1158,Section_1,Mike Quigley,"So it was something along the lines of, “It’s okay for you to ask us to investigate in the manner in which you are, these so-called investigations, but you don’t want us to investigate our own president.” Is that a fair way to describe this?",01:18:27,Volker/Morrison
1159,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Well, I didn’t quite understand what he was referring to because, to my knowledge, we weren’t asking to investigate Clinton or Biden. And so I was kind of puzzled by the remark, and that’s why I didn’t respond.",01:18:44,Volker/Morrison
1160,Section_1,Mike Quigley,Did you go and investigate what he might’ve meant or ask anybody?,01:18:56,Volker/Morrison
1161,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, I took it something of a deflection from the point I was making about unifying Ukraine.",01:18:59,Volker/Morrison
1162,Section_1,Mike Quigley,"But in all this time, I mean, Mr. Giuliani in this time, in that May to September, he mentioned the Biden investigation. He mentioned Biden over 50 times and 20-something times in relation to Ukraine. None of that stirred your curiosity? You’ve just now finally come to this point?",01:19:06,Volker/Morrison
1163,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah. As I testified, I met with Mr. Giuliani once. And he did bring up Vice President Biden, and I pushed back on that. And I maintained a very clear distinction that Ukraine investigating its own citizens and corruption would be fine. Going beyond that to say, “We’re going to investigate the vice president,” is not fine.",01:19:26,Volker/Morrison
1164,Section_1,Mike Quigley,Did you have any discussions with anyone in the State Department or anywhere else in the administration about concerns about the investigation into Poroshenko?,01:19:44,Volker/Morrison
1165,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, so I know that I raised this with Ambassador Taylor in advance of that. We had been in some of the same meetings, some of the country team there. I don’t remember whether I had raised it with George Kent or Phil Reeker or not. I may well have done, but it was something that we had discussed as part of our meetings in Kiev at that time.",01:19:53,Volker/Morrison
1166,Section_1,Mike Quigley,I yield to the chairman.,01:20:15,Volker/Morrison
1167,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"So Ambassador, when you had this conversation and you urged Ukrainians not to investigate or prosecute the former President Poroshenko, their response was, “Oh, you mean like you’re asking us to investigate the Clintons and the Bidens?” That was their response?",01:20:17,Volker/Morrison
1168,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"That’s what I recall now from seeing Ambassador Taylor’s testimony, yes.",01:20:32,Volker/Morrison
1169,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And you didn’t understand that at the time, but then at the time, had you read the call record?",01:20:36,Volker/Morrison
1170,Section_1,Kurt Volker,No.,01:20:42,Volker/Morrison
1171,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Now that you’ve read the call record, that makes a little more sense, doesn’t it?",01:20:43,Volker/Morrison
1172,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:20:48,Volker/Morrison
1173,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"I was curious about something you said earlier when you said that the 2016 conspiracy theory of Lutsenko had no merit, but you didn’t see any harm in Ukraine investigating it if they want to investigate it. Is that right?",01:20:48,Volker/Morrison
1174,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:21:02,Volker/Morrison
1175,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Don’t they have enough legitimate corruption to investigate without spending time investigating a debunk conspiracy theory?,01:21:04,Volker/Morrison
1176,Section_1,Kurt Volker,There is all kinds of corruption to investigate in Ukraine.,01:21:12,Volker/Morrison
1177,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"But nonetheless, you proposed that they go ahead and do this investigation of something you thought without merit because this was part of an effort to fix the problem that Giuliani was creating?",01:21:15,Volker/Morrison
1178,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I did not propose it.,01:21:24,Volker/Morrison
1179,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Well, I think you said you were okay with it or you amended statements-",01:21:26,Volker/Morrison
1180,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I did, yes.",01:21:30,Volker/Morrison
1181,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"… as we’ve seen, to include it because, well, if it would help fix the Giuliani problem, was that the thinking?",01:21:30,Volker/Morrison
1182,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, that’s correct. If it threads the needle between what is reasonable for Ukraine to do and if it resets the negative perceptions held by Mr. Giuliani and then the president, then why not?",01:21:37,Volker/Morrison
1183,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"This was part of what you described in your opening statement as your effort to, when you see a problem, to fix it. Is it clear to now, Ambassador Volker, based on the September 25th call, that you were not able to fix it?",01:21:49,Volker/Morrison
1184,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Based on the transcript that was released on the 25th, I can see now that there was a lot else going on that was about Vice President Biden than I knew at the time. And the efforts that I was making were clearly not in the context of what had already been discussed by the president on July 25th.",01:22:02,Volker/Morrison
1185,Section_1,Adam Schiff,So it’s fair to say you were not able to fix the Giuliani problem.,01:22:21,Volker/Morrison
1186,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:22:25,Volker/Morrison
1187,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Ms. Stefanik.,01:22:29,Volker/Morrison
1188,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"Thank you, Ambassador Volker and Mr. Morrison, for your years of service and your professional expertise and leadership on national security issues. And I want to particularly thank Mr. Morrison for his great work on the House Armed Services Committee on which I serve.",01:22:31,Volker/Morrison
1189,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"I wanted to start with a July 25th call between President Trump and President Zelensky. Mr. Morrison, you were on that call, and there was no mention of withholding aid on the call, correct?",01:22:45,Volker/Morrison
1190,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"That is correct, Councilwoman.",01:22:55,Volker/Morrison
1191,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And there was no quid pro quo, correct?",01:22:56,Volker/Morrison
1192,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Correct.,01:22:59,Volker/Morrison
1193,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,No bribery?,01:22:59,Volker/Morrison
1194,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Correct.,01:23:01,Volker/Morrison
1195,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,No extortion?,01:23:01,Volker/Morrison
1196,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Correct.,01:23:03,Volker/Morrison
1197,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And Ambassador Volker, I presume you got a readout of the call. Is that correct?",01:23:04,Volker/Morrison
1198,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"A very terse readout, but yes.",01:23:10,Volker/Morrison
1199,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"In this terse readout of the call, Ambassador, from the US participants, was there any reference to withholding aid?",01:23:12,Volker/Morrison
1200,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, there was not.",01:23:19,Volker/Morrison
1201,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,Any reference to bribery?,01:23:19,Volker/Morrison
1202,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, there was not.",01:23:21,Volker/Morrison
1203,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,Any reference to quid pro quo?,01:23:22,Volker/Morrison
1204,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, there was not.",01:23:23,Volker/Morrison
1205,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,Any reference to extortion?,01:23:24,Volker/Morrison
1206,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, there was not.",01:23:27,Volker/Morrison
1207,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,And I presume you also got feedback from your Ukrainian counterparts as to how the call went. Did they mention the withholding of aid?,01:23:27,Volker/Morrison
1208,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, they did not.",01:23:34,Volker/Morrison
1209,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,Did they mention any quid pro quo?,01:23:35,Volker/Morrison
1210,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, they did not.",01:23:37,Volker/Morrison
1211,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,And did they mention any bribery?,01:23:37,Volker/Morrison
1212,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, they did not.",01:23:40,Volker/Morrison
1213,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And in fact, the day after the call, you met with President Zelensky. This would be on July 26th.",01:23:41,Volker/Morrison
1214,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:23:47,Volker/Morrison
1215,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And in that meeting, he made no mention of quid pro quo.",01:23:47,Volker/Morrison
1216,Section_1,Kurt Volker,No.,01:23:51,Volker/Morrison
1217,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,He made no mention of withholding the aid.,01:23:51,Volker/Morrison
1218,Section_1,Kurt Volker,No.,01:23:53,Volker/Morrison
1219,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,He made no mention of bribery.,01:23:54,Volker/Morrison
1220,Section_1,Kurt Volker,No.,01:23:55,Volker/Morrison
1221,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"So the fact is, the Ukrainians were not even aware of this hold on aid. Is that correct?",01:23:56,Volker/Morrison
1222,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:24:01,Volker/Morrison
1223,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And in the coming weeks, you were in touch with Ukrainians as part of your official duties, and this included talking to Ukrainians over the phone, in person, on text. And the Ukrainians never brought up an investigation into the Bidens. Is that correct?",01:24:02,Volker/Morrison
1224,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:24:16,Volker/Morrison
1225,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,They never brought up the withholding of the aid.,01:24:17,Volker/Morrison
1226,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:24:20,Volker/Morrison
1227,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,They never brought up quid pro quo or bribery.,01:24:21,Volker/Morrison
1228,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Let me bring up the aid. They did bring that up after the Politico article appeared on [crosstalk 00:24:28].,01:24:24,Volker/Morrison
1229,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"I’m going to get to that, but until the Politico article, they did not bring it up.",01:24:28,Volker/Morrison
1230,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Until then, no.",01:24:32,Volker/Morrison
1231,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And you said in your closed-door deposition, quote, “It never came up in conversation with them, and I believe they had trust in me that they would have asked if that was really what they were worried about.” Is that correct?",01:24:33,Volker/Morrison
1232,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:24:45,Volker/Morrison
1233,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And as you pointed out, the Ukrainians never even knew their foreign aid was on pause until the article was published in Politico in August.",01:24:45,Volker/Morrison
1234,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:24:53,Volker/Morrison
1235,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,So they didn’t know during the call.,01:24:54,Volker/Morrison
1236,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s correct.,01:24:56,Volker/Morrison
1237,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And in fact, you had to correct Chairman Schiff on this timeline in the closed-door deposition. The chairman of this committee asked you, quote, “When they became aware that military assistance was being withheld for a reason you couldn’t explain, no one could explain, weren’t they under even greater pressure to give the president what he asked for on the call?”",01:24:57,Volker/Morrison
1238,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And you answered, Ambassador Volker, quote, “To my knowledge, the news about a hold on security assistance did not get into Ukrainian government circles as indicated to me by the current foreign minister, then diplomatic advisor, until the end of August.” Is that your testimony?",01:25:17,Volker/Morrison
1239,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, it is.",01:25:33,Volker/Morrison
1240,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"And Chairman Schiff also got the facts wrong again when he asked you this, quote, “At the point they learned their aid was paused, wouldn’t that give them added urgency to meet the president’s request on the Bidens?” And you answered, Ambassador Volker, quote, “I think the Ukrainians felt like they are going in the right direction, and they had not done anything. They had not done anything on an investigation,” end quote. Isn’t it the case, Ambassador Volker, at one point, Chairman Schiff said to you when you were truthfully testifying, quote, “Ambassador, you’re making this much more complicated than it has to be,” end quote. It’s page 127 from the deposition. Is that correct?",01:25:34,Volker/Morrison
1241,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I remember that.,01:26:14,Volker/Morrison
1242,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"But the truth is, the facts are indeed not complicated, and I’m going to close out with two questions for the both of you. Did Ukraine open investigation into the Bidens? Mr. Morrison.",01:26:16,Volker/Morrison
1243,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Not to my knowledge, ma’am.",01:26:26,Volker/Morrison
1244,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,Ambassador Volker.,01:26:28,Volker/Morrison
1245,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Not to my knowledge either.,01:26:29,Volker/Morrison
1246,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,Did either of you ever have any evidence of quid pro quo? Mr. Morrison.,01:26:31,Volker/Morrison
1247,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, ma’am.",01:26:36,Volker/Morrison
1248,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,Ambassador Volker.,01:26:36,Volker/Morrison
1249,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I did not.,01:26:37,Volker/Morrison
1250,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,Any evidence of bribery?,01:26:38,Volker/Morrison
1251,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, ma’am.",01:26:40,Volker/Morrison
1252,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, ma’am.",01:26:40,Volker/Morrison
1253,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,Any evidence of treason?,01:26:42,Volker/Morrison
1254,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, ma’am.",01:26:44,Volker/Morrison
1255,Section_1,Kurt Volker,No evidence of treason.,01:26:44,Volker/Morrison
1256,Section_1,Elise Stefanik,"With that, I yield back.",01:26:46,Volker/Morrison
1257,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Swalwell.,01:26:47,Volker/Morrison
1258,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"Thank you. Mr. Morrison, did Ambassador Bolton want the security aid hold lifted?",01:26:51,Volker/Morrison
1259,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, Congressman, he did.",01:27:00,Volker/Morrison
1260,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,You testified that Ambassador Bolton had a one-on-one meeting with President Trump in late August related to Ukraine security assistance. Is that right?,01:27:02,Volker/Morrison
1261,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, can you point to where I testified to that?",01:27:11,Volker/Morrison
1262,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"On page 266, you said, “Ambassador Bolton had a one-on-one meeting with President Trump in late August 2019, but the president was not yet ready to approve the release of the assistance.” Do you remember that?",01:27:13,Volker/Morrison
1263,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, this is 226?",01:27:24,Volker/Morrison
1264,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"Yes, 266 and 268. But I’m asking you, did that happen, or did it not?",01:27:26,Volker/Morrison
1265,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I just want to be … I want to be clear characterizing it. Okay. Yes, sir. I see. Yes.",01:27:33,Volker/Morrison
1266,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,And you testified to that. What was the outcome of that meeting between Ambassador Bolton and President Trump?,01:27:44,Volker/Morrison
1267,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Ambassador Bolton did not yet believe the president was ready to approve the assistance.,01:27:49,Volker/Morrison
1268,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,Did Ambassador Bolton inform you of any reason for the ongoing hold that stemmed from this meeting?,01:27:54,Volker/Morrison
1269,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, sir.",01:27:58,Volker/Morrison
1270,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"Mr. Morrison, do you consider yourself loyal to the president?",01:28:03,Volker/Morrison
1271,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, sir.",01:28:10,Volker/Morrison
1272,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,And the president executes the foreign policy of the United States. Is that right?,01:28:11,Volker/Morrison
1273,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Well, sir, I would say he decides-",01:28:17,Volker/Morrison
1274,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,He sets the foreign policy.,01:28:18,Volker/Morrison
1275,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"He sets it. Yes, sir.",01:28:19,Volker/Morrison
1276,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"And as a staffer on the National Security Council and even someone who serves in the military, it’s your job to faithfully execute the foreign policy priorities of the president. Is that right?",01:28:20,Volker/Morrison
1277,Section_1,Tim Morrison,My oath is to obey all lawful orders.,01:28:31,Volker/Morrison
1278,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"On July 25, you listened to the president of the United States talk to the president of Ukraine. Is that correct?",01:28:35,Volker/Morrison
1279,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"July 25th, yes, sir.",01:28:40,Volker/Morrison
1280,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"And regardless of what you had prepared as far as talking points for that call for the president, you heard the president of the United States ask the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Is that correct?",01:28:41,Volker/Morrison
1281,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, sir. He made a request.",01:28:55,Volker/Morrison
1282,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"And after the July 25 call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, fair to say that you talked to your Ukrainian counterparts a number of times?",01:28:57,Volker/Morrison
1283,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, sir.",01:29:08,Volker/Morrison
1284,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"How many times, when you talk to your Ukrainian counterparts, did you ask them to investigate the Bidens?",01:29:09,Volker/Morrison
1285,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Never, sir.",01:29:15,Volker/Morrison
1286,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,Why not?,01:29:17,Volker/Morrison
1287,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, it was not a policy objective that I was aware of.",01:29:21,Volker/Morrison
1288,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"But with all due respect, Mr. Morrison, you’re not in the White House to carry out your policy objectives. You just testified that the president sets the foreign policy objectives for the United States. And the one call that you listened to between the president of the United States and the president of Ukraine, the president of the United States’ priorities were to investigate the Bidens. And I’m asking you, sir, why didn’t you follow up on the president’s priorities when you talked to the Ukrainians?",01:29:24,Volker/Morrison
1289,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I did not understand it as a policy objective.",01:29:52,Volker/Morrison
1290,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"Mr. Morrison, I know that you put that conversation in the server because-",01:29:58,Volker/Morrison
1291,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"I know that you put that conversation in the server because as you said, you feared the political consequences and some other reasons that you gave, but you also chose to defy the President’s request to not come here as others have, like Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Bolton, and you have come here and you’ve been truthful and I appreciate that. And Mr. Morrison, whether you acknowledge it publicly or not, I believe that you knew that what the President asked the Ukrainians to do was wrong.",01:30:03,Volker/Morrison
1292,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"And as you just described, your duty is to follow the foreign policy priorities of the President, but to also only follow something that is a lawful order. And I don’t think you believe that was a lawful order and that’s why you did not follow up on those priorities.",01:30:31,Volker/Morrison
1293,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"Mr. Volker, we’ve heard a lot today about this president being such an anti-corruption president. He really cared about fighting corruption. Is Russia a corrupt country?",01:30:47,Volker/Morrison
1294,Section_1,Kurt Volker,We’re talking about President Zelinsky?,01:31:02,Volker/Morrison
1295,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"No, President Trump.",01:31:04,Volker/Morrison
1296,Section_1,Kurt Volker,President Trump.,01:31:04,Volker/Morrison
1297,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,Is Russia a corrupt country?,01:31:05,Volker/Morrison
1298,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes it is.,01:31:06,Volker/Morrison
1299,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"And President Trump has met a number of times in person with President Putin, is that right?",01:31:08,Volker/Morrison
1300,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, a few times.",01:31:13,Volker/Morrison
1301,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"And he’s had a number of phone calls with President Putin, is that right?",01:31:14,Volker/Morrison
1302,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:31:17,Volker/Morrison
1303,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,Is Turkey a corrupt country?,01:31:18,Volker/Morrison
1304,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I believe so.",01:31:19,Volker/Morrison
1305,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"And just last week, despite their corruption at the White House, President Erdogan had an audience with the President of the United States, is that correct?",01:31:21,Volker/Morrison
1306,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, he did.",01:31:28,Volker/Morrison
1307,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"Finally, Mr. Giuliani on May 9th told the New York Times, President Trump basically knows what I’m doing as his lawyer. Are you familiar with that statement to the New York Times?",01:31:29,Volker/Morrison
1308,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, I’m not.",01:31:43,Volker/Morrison
1309,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"But you agree as someone who has a lawyer sitting next to you that a lawyer acts on a client’s behalf and only on a client’s behalf, is that right?",01:31:44,Volker/Morrison
1310,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I believe that a lawyer acts on his client’s behalf. I’m not sure about only on a client’s behalf, because I think as I understood Mayor Giuliani in this case, he was doing a lot that I considered to be on his own. I did not believe he was always instructed.",01:31:53,Volker/Morrison
1311,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,"And when he said, we’re not meddling in an election or meddling in an investigation, he didn’t say I, he said we. Is that correct?",01:32:08,Volker/Morrison
1312,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I am taking that from the statement.,01:32:16,Volker/Morrison
1313,Section_1,Eric Swalwell,Yield back.,01:32:19,Volker/Morrison
1314,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Hurd.,01:32:20,Volker/Morrison
1315,Section_1,Will Hurd,"Mr. Morrison, my colleague from California suggests he knows your opinions and your thoughts better than you do. Do you have anything? He didn’t give you the opportunity to respond. Do you have a response or want to give a response?",01:32:22,Volker/Morrison
1316,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No, sir. I heard the President make a request. I received no direction at any time to attempt to weed a policy process different from what I laid out in my deposition. I was directed by Dr. Copperman to launch an inter agency process to ensure a unity of opinion in the inter agency as to the importance of continuing security sector assistance. And that’s what I did. I acted upon the direction I was given.",01:32:36,Volker/Morrison
1317,Section_1,Will Hurd,"Good copy. While we’re with you Mr. Morrison. Thanks for your testimony, your clear and sober testimony today. Did you participate in or overhear any conversations about how political information collected by Ukraine on the Bidens would be used for political gain?",01:33:04,Volker/Morrison
1318,Section_1,Tim Morrison,No sir.,01:33:21,Volker/Morrison
1319,Section_1,Will Hurd,"Ambassador Volker, same question. Did you participate in or overhear any conversations about how potential information collected by Ukraine on the Bidens would be used for political gain?",01:33:22,Volker/Morrison
1320,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, I did not.",01:33:34,Volker/Morrison
1321,Section_1,Will Hurd,"There’s been a lot of discussions about a text exchange you had with Mr. [Yermack 01:33:41] on August 12th that talked about this proposed statement, and Mayor Giuliani provided some feedback on what he thought needed to be included in that. Did Mayor Giuliani get feedback from the President on what should go into that proposed statement?",01:33:35,Volker/Morrison
1322,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I have no reason to think that he had discussed it with the President.,01:33:57,Volker/Morrison
1323,Section_1,Will Hurd,"Based on your recollection, Ambassador Volker, who within the Zelinsky regime has Mayor Giuliani interacted with? Now in addition to Mr. Yermack, which we’ve already talked about, and also the former Attorney General, Mr. [Lushanko 01:34:19].",01:34:04,Volker/Morrison
1324,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah, I don’t know who else he would have interacted [inaudible 01:34:22], having claimed that he met [inaudible 01:34:24] predecessor as Prosecutor General Mr. Lushanko.",01:34:19,Volker/Morrison
1325,Section_1,Will Hurd,"Yeah, but that’s not within-",01:34:26,Volker/Morrison
1326,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s not under the Zelinsky government.,01:34:27,Volker/Morrison
1327,Section_1,Will Hurd,The current regime in which we’re talking about.,01:34:30,Volker/Morrison
1328,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I don’t know who else he would’ve met with.,01:34:32,Volker/Morrison
1329,Section_1,Will Hurd,"In as few words as possible, what was your understanding of Ambassador Sondland’s role in Ukraine?",01:34:34,Volker/Morrison
1330,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"He cared about Ukraine. He wanted to see U.S. support for Ukraine increased. He wanted to see European union support for Ukraine increased, including maintenance of sanctions, and he wanted to be helpful.",01:34:41,Volker/Morrison
1331,Section_1,Will Hurd,Was Ambassador Sondland having conversations with senior Zelinsky officials without letting other people know?,01:34:54,Volker/Morrison
1332,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I don’t believe that he was not letting people know. I think he may have had some conversations, but I think he was just acting, and I think we circled back quite frequently with myself, Ambassador Taylor and others.",01:35:00,Volker/Morrison
1333,Section_1,Will Hurd,Can you say that you have a clear understanding of what Ambassador Sondland and Mayor Giuliani were doing in all their interactions with Ukrainian officials?,01:35:14,Volker/Morrison
1334,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I can’t say that I had a clear understanding. I thought that Ambassador Sondland and I were working on the same objective, which is getting a meeting between President Zelinsky and President Trump, and that a statement as I understood it that mentioned Barisma in 2016 would be potentially helpful. I didn’t know anything more about their interactions or what their thoughts were.",01:35:24,Volker/Morrison
1335,Section_1,Will Hurd,"If you didn’t have a clear understanding as the special representative of Ukraine, do you think the Ukrainians had a clear understanding?",01:35:47,Volker/Morrison
1336,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, I don’t.",01:35:54,Volker/Morrison
1337,Section_1,Will Hurd,"You thought there was a difference between Barisma and Biden in the 2016 elections, is that correct?",01:35:56,Volker/Morrison
1338,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:36:01,Volker/Morrison
1339,Section_1,Will Hurd,As you testified earlier. Do you think the Ukrainians had similar understanding?,01:36:01,Volker/Morrison
1340,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I do.",01:36:05,Volker/Morrison
1341,Section_1,Will Hurd,"There’s also a perception that when Ambassador Yovanovitch, who we’ve all, her 33 years of being an awesome ambassador, that when she left Kiev that the U.S. position on corruption would weaken. That’s kind of a narrative that’s floating around. Who was the person that took over for her in the interim, who was the charge after-",01:36:08,Volker/Morrison
1342,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Immediately after Masha was Joe Pennington.,01:36:30,Volker/Morrison
1343,Section_1,Will Hurd,Was this individual strong or weak on corruption?,01:36:34,Volker/Morrison
1344,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I would say in line with all the rest of our policy.,01:36:38,Volker/Morrison
1345,Section_1,Will Hurd,And after that individual who was that person replaced with?,01:36:42,Volker/Morrison
1346,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Then that was Bill Taylor.,01:36:45,Volker/Morrison
1347,Section_1,Will Hurd,"Who you suggested for that position, correct?",01:36:46,Volker/Morrison
1348,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:36:48,Volker/Morrison
1349,Section_1,Will Hurd,Was Ambassador Taylor strong or weak on corruption?,01:36:48,Volker/Morrison
1350,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Very strong.,01:36:52,Volker/Morrison
1351,Section_1,Will Hurd,"Mr. Morrison in my last 23 minutes, who sets official U.S. policy?",01:36:53,Volker/Morrison
1352,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, the President.",01:36:58,Volker/Morrison
1353,Section_1,Will Hurd,Not some other staffer within the NSC process?,01:37:01,Volker/Morrison
1354,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, the NSC staff exists to ensure the President has a full array of options for his decision.",01:37:06,Volker/Morrison
1355,Section_1,Will Hurd,Thank you. I yield back.,01:37:12,Volker/Morrison
1356,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Castro.,01:37:14,Volker/Morrison
1357,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"Thank you, chairman. Thank you gentlemen, for your testimony today. Is it correct to say that both you gentlemen were either appointed or hired by the White House, by the Trump administration?",01:37:16,Volker/Morrison
1358,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, sir.",01:37:27,Volker/Morrison
1359,Section_1,Kurt Volker,In my case by Secretary Tillerson.,01:37:28,Volker/Morrison
1360,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,But part of the Trump administration.,01:37:30,Volker/Morrison
1361,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, serving in the same administration.",01:37:32,Volker/Morrison
1362,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"Sure. Ambassador Volker, you previously testified that Ambassador Gordon Sondland, “I just know that he had a relationship with President Trump that I did not have”. In fact, in one text message dated July 26th you wrote to Ambassador Sondland, “Great photo Gordon, can you get this to POTUS without intermediaries?”. July 26th was the same day that Ambassador Sondland spoke to the President from a restaurant in Kiev, is that right?",01:37:34,Volker/Morrison
1363,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I’m sorry, the date again?",01:38:07,Volker/Morrison
1364,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,July 26th.,01:38:08,Volker/Morrison
1365,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I know that to be correct now.",01:38:10,Volker/Morrison
1366,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,Were you aware of that call?,01:38:13,Volker/Morrison
1367,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, I was not.",01:38:14,Volker/Morrison
1368,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,Well this committee certainly is aware of it now as we all are. Were you aware that Ambassador Sondland had a direct line to the President?,01:38:16,Volker/Morrison
1369,Section_1,Kurt Volker,He claimed that he spoke to the President frequently.,01:38:24,Volker/Morrison
1370,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,Did you have reason to doubt that?,01:38:26,Volker/Morrison
1371,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Ambassador Sondland’s a big personality and sometimes says things that might be a bit bigger than life, but I-",01:38:28,Volker/Morrison
1372,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"But he too, he was a political appointee. He was handpicked by the President or somebody in the President’s administration to serve in his position.",01:38:37,Volker/Morrison
1373,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Right, and I believe that he could speak with the President.",01:38:44,Volker/Morrison
1374,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,He had also been a large donor to one of President Trump’s campaign committees. Is that correct?,01:38:46,Volker/Morrison
1375,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I have learned that yes.,01:38:52,Volker/Morrison
1376,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"Mr. Morrison, you stated during your testimony that when you met Ambassador Sondland for the first time, he represented that, “His mandate from the President was to go make deals”. And in fact you testified that between July 25th and September 11th of this year, you heard or learned that Ambassador Sondland and President Trump spoke on several occasions. Is it accurate that every time you checked you were able to confirm that Ambassador Sondland had in fact spoken to the President?",01:38:54,Volker/Morrison
1377,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes Congressman.,01:39:24,Volker/Morrison
1378,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"Mr. Morrison, you also testified that Ambassador Sondland emailed you and several White House staff to say that he briefed President Trump in advance of his July 25th call with the Ukrainian president. Is that correct?",01:39:26,Volker/Morrison
1379,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes Congressman.,01:39:38,Volker/Morrison
1380,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,Did Ambassador Sondland and tell you what he briefed the President on?,01:39:39,Volker/Morrison
1381,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"It was, he sent me an email, sir. It was a very succinct, it was a list of three items. It was a very succinct item with respect to Ukraine. I briefed the President on the call.",01:39:43,Volker/Morrison
1382,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,And you testified that you personally confirmed that Ambassador Sondland and President Trump had spoken before the July 25th call.,01:39:55,Volker/Morrison
1383,Section_1,Tim Morrison,That is correct Congressman.,01:40:03,Volker/Morrison
1384,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,And presumably the White House situation room keeps a record of those calls.,01:40:05,Volker/Morrison
1385,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, that is how I was able to confirm it.",01:40:11,Volker/Morrison
1386,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"Okay. You separately testify that your staff prepared a briefing memo with suggested points for the President to raise on July 25th. Points that were consistent with U.S. policy, is that correct?",01:40:14,Volker/Morrison
1387,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Correct Congressman.,01:40:25,Volker/Morrison
1388,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"But the President didn’t use those points, did he?",01:40:26,Volker/Morrison
1389,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No sir, he did not.",01:40:29,Volker/Morrison
1390,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"So I guess, let me get this straight. You prepared materials for the President, your materials did not include references to Biden or the 2016 election, is that right?",01:40:30,Volker/Morrison
1391,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Correct Congressman.,01:40:41,Volker/Morrison
1392,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"And then Ambassador Sondland, the guy who is the Gordon problem, the guy who’s got a direct link to the President, the guy who’s talking about making deals briefed President Trump, is that right?",01:40:42,Volker/Morrison
1393,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Correct Congressman.,01:40:55,Volker/Morrison
1394,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"And then President Trump raised the 2016 election, and Vice President Biden and his son to the Ukrainian president after he was briefed by Ambassador Sondland. Is that right?",01:40:57,Volker/Morrison
1395,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Correct Congressman.,01:41:10,Volker/Morrison
1396,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,"It sounds like Ambassador Sondland and the President were on the same page. They both were working to benefit the President’s personal political interest even when that undermined U.S. foreign policy. I want to ask you in the short time that I have both you gentlemen who served the United States government, whether, putting President Trump aside, whether you believe that it’s proper for any president now or later to ask a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen, and specifically a U.S. citizen that could be a political rival. Ambassador?",01:41:12,Volker/Morrison
1397,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I don’t believe it is appropriate for the President to do that. If we have law enforcement concerns with a U.S. citizen, generally there are appropriate channels for that.",01:41:52,Volker/Morrison
1398,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,Mr. Morrison?,01:42:02,Volker/Morrison
1399,Section_1,Tim Morrison,I agree with Ambassador Volker sir.,01:42:03,Volker/Morrison
1400,Section_1,Joaquin Castro,Thank you chairman. I yield back.,01:42:06,Volker/Morrison
1401,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Ratcliffe.,01:42:09,Volker/Morrison
1402,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"Thank you chairman. Gentleman, I appreciate both of you being here today. I know it’s been a long day for you. Mr. Morrison I’m going to try and summarize some of what we’ve heard to shorten this. You were on the July 25th call, Colonel Vindman was on the July 25th call, correct?",01:42:11,Volker/Morrison
1403,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes Congressman.,01:42:29,Volker/Morrison
1404,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"And I will tell you that he testified earlier today that he heard what he thought was a demand on that call that was improper and felt that he had a duty to report that. I think we’ve established already that he did not discuss or report any of that to you, correct?",01:42:30,Volker/Morrison
1405,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes Congressman.,01:42:48,Volker/Morrison
1406,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"But you did have a discussion with Colonel Vindman about other concerns that he had with the call, and I believe you said the fidelity of the translation, and the fact that you both shared a discussion about there not being a full throated embrace of the Ukrainian reform agenda. Is that fair?",01:42:50,Volker/Morrison
1407,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes Congressman.,01:43:08,Volker/Morrison
1408,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"Okay. But with respect to his concern about something improper, specifically at no point did he come to you and say, I heard something that I thought was improper and was a crime.",01:43:09,Volker/Morrison
1409,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I have no recollection of him doing that.",01:43:25,Volker/Morrison
1410,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"No bribe, no extortion, no quid pro quo. All the things that Miss Stefanik asked you?",01:43:27,Volker/Morrison
1411,Section_1,Tim Morrison,No sir.,01:43:31,Volker/Morrison
1412,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"All right. And as you were listening, did you hear President Trump make a demand of anything that would constitute a crime?",01:43:32,Volker/Morrison
1413,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I’ve been trying to stay on the safe side of making legal conclusions, but no sir, I did not hear him make any sort of demand.",01:43:44,Volker/Morrison
1414,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,You have a law degree?,01:43:49,Volker/Morrison
1415,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I do, sir.",01:43:51,Volker/Morrison
1416,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"So you’re at least generally familiar with bribery and extortion, generally.",01:43:51,Volker/Morrison
1417,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I’m not a lawyer for the United States, sir.",01:43:56,Volker/Morrison
1418,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"All right. But is it fair to say that as you were listening to the call, you weren’t thinking, wow, the President is bribing the President of Ukraine? That never crossed your mind.",01:43:58,Volker/Morrison
1419,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"It did not, sir.",01:44:08,Volker/Morrison
1420,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,Or that he was extorting the President of the Ukraine.,01:44:09,Volker/Morrison
1421,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"It did not, sir.",01:44:12,Volker/Morrison
1422,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,Or doing anything improper?,01:44:13,Volker/Morrison
1423,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Correct sir.,01:44:15,Volker/Morrison
1424,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"All right, and have you heard or read in the media where President Zelinsky agrees with you, and said repeatedly and consistently that he didn’t hear any demand, he didn’t hear any conditions, he didn’t feel any pressure, he didn’t experience anything improper or corrupt on the call?",01:44:15,Volker/Morrison
1425,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I attended the [bylat 01:44:32] in New York at the UN General Assembly and he made clear at the time in front of the press that he felt no pressure.",01:44:31,Volker/Morrison
1426,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"So did anyone on the national security council after this call express to you that some crime, bribery, extortion, quid pro quo, anything had occurred?",01:44:38,Volker/Morrison
1427,Section_1,Tim Morrison,No sir.,01:44:50,Volker/Morrison
1428,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"I want to ask you, Mr. Morrison, about the whistleblower complaint. I don’t want to ask you to speculate as to the identity, but I want to ask you about the accusations that started this as to their veracity. First of all, the whistleblower who apparently was not on the call advised the ICIG that he or she was concerned that the President’s conduct constituted under Title 50 USC Section 30.33, “A serious problem, abuse or violation of law or executive order”. Again, to be clear, you didn’t hear a violation of law or executive order as you listened to the call.",01:44:54,Volker/Morrison
1429,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I made no judgment about any illegal conduct occurring.",01:45:41,Volker/Morrison
1430,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"The whistleblower also reported in starting this inquiry, asserted that President Trump, “sought to pressure the Ukrainian leadership to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid”. President Trump does not mention 2020 during the call, does he?",01:45:45,Volker/Morrison
1431,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No sir, I don’t believe he did.",01:46:06,Volker/Morrison
1432,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,President Trump doesn’t mention his reelection bid during the call does he?,01:46:07,Volker/Morrison
1433,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I don’t believe he did.",01:46:12,Volker/Morrison
1434,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"And you did not hear President Trump pressure or have a demand of any kind as we’ve already established, correct?",01:46:14,Volker/Morrison
1435,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Correct sir.,01:46:21,Volker/Morrison
1436,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,A whistleblower like Colonel Vindman also uses the word demand.,01:46:21,Volker/Morrison
1437,Section_1,Counsel,Did you say whistleblower like Colonel Vindman? I don’t think that’s a fact that’s in evidence.,01:46:26,Volker/Morrison
1438,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Counsel you should use a microphone.,01:46:35,Volker/Morrison
1439,Section_1,Counsel,"Thank you, I’m sorry. And all due respect Congressman. I believe you just said a whistleblower like Colonel Vindman.",01:46:36,Volker/Morrison
1440,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"No, I said, I’m sorry.",01:46:42,Volker/Morrison
1441,Section_1,Counsel,That’s not in evidence.,01:46:44,Volker/Morrison
1442,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"Yeah, the whistleblower, like Colonel Vindman, also uses the word demand. On page four, the whistleblower asserted, “Ambassador Volker and Sondland purportedly provided advice to Ukrainian leadership about how to navigate the demands the President had made of Mr. Zelinsky”. Again, there were no demands from your perspective, Mr. Morrison.",01:46:45,Volker/Morrison
1443,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"That is correct, sir.",01:47:07,Volker/Morrison
1444,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,"All right, so speculations about the whistleblower aside with regard to motivations, the fact is that the whistleblower was wrong about many of the facts as well, correct?",01:47:08,Volker/Morrison
1445,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I’m not intimately familiar with the whistleblower complaint, but I did not hear a demand in that call.",01:47:23,Volker/Morrison
1446,Section_1,John Ratcliffe,I yield back.,01:47:28,Volker/Morrison
1447,Section_1,Adam Schiff,The time for the gentleman has expired. Mr. Heck.,01:47:28,Volker/Morrison
1448,Section_1,Denny Heck,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Volker, I want to thank you for being here today and I frankly found some of your opening statement to be not just genuine but downright eloquent. In particular I noted the passages about pushing back on Russian aggression and supporting the development of a strong, resilient, democratic and prosperous Ukraine. One that overcomes a legacy of corruption and that this is critically important for U.S. national security.",01:47:35,Volker/Morrison
1449,Section_1,Denny Heck,"Some of us believe that we’re not pushing back strongly enough on Russia. Some of us believe we’re not being supportive enough of the Ukraine, but one of our challenges is to go home to the people for whom we work and help explain to them why it is in our national security interest. You have an audience like you’ll never have again to look into the camera and tell the American public why it is important to support Ukraine, why it should matter to them if the biggest issue in their life is getting their kids off to school, paying their bills and the like. Sir.",01:48:05,Volker/Morrison
1450,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Thank you so much Congressman. I agree with you completely that we are not pushing back hard enough on Russia and that we owe Ukraine a great deal of support.,01:48:40,Volker/Morrison
1451,Section_1,Denny Heck,Why does it matter?,01:48:50,Volker/Morrison
1452,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Russia is trying to upend security in Europe. It’s trying to reassert its domination of neighboring countries, whether it’s Georgia or Ukraine or the Baltic States. It has led to war in Europe. The war in Ukraine has left more people dead in Europe in a European war than anything since the Balkans. More people displaced by a war in Europe since anything since World War II. These are people who stand up for freedom, for democracy, they want reform, they want to see their country be successful, like Germany, like Sweden, like us. And they are fighting a war of aggression against them, designed to hold them back. And if we want to live in a world of freedom for the United States, we ought to be supporting freedom for people around the world.",01:48:54,Volker/Morrison
1453,Section_1,Denny Heck,"Thank you for that. So we’re here in part because under cover of a concern for general corruption, some of us believe there wasn’t. In fact, there was something quite nefarious as the alternative that there wasn’t a concern about general corruption. But reviewing the record on that, sir, is it not true that in March of this year, the department of defense certified Ukraine as having been sufficient, have made sufficient progress to continue to receive military assistance?",01:49:42,Volker/Morrison
1454,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I don’t know the details of that, but I believe that to be correct.",01:50:10,Volker/Morrison
1455,Section_1,Denny Heck,"Is it not true that on April 21st President Zelinsky, when an overwhelming mandate was 73% of the vote based largely on his effort and advocacy for anti-corruption.",01:50:13,Volker/Morrison
1456,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:50:22,Volker/Morrison
1457,Section_1,Denny Heck,Is it not true that this mandate was affirmed and expanded on July 21st when his party won one party control again on the basis of anti-corruption?,01:50:23,Volker/Morrison
1458,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:50:30,Volker/Morrison
1459,Section_1,Denny Heck,"In fact, subsequently he enacted sweeping reforms to combat anti-corruption, did he not?",01:50:32,Volker/Morrison
1460,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes he has.,01:50:38,Volker/Morrison
1461,Section_1,Denny Heck,"And is it not true that everybody on the ground thought, or was filled with optimism that Ukraine was getting serious about combating corruption?",01:50:39,Volker/Morrison
1462,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,01:50:48,Volker/Morrison
1463,Section_1,Denny Heck,"Ambassador Volker, did you know that one of the very first anti-corruption measures passed in the Ukraine was a law to provide for the impeachment of the President?",01:50:49,Volker/Morrison
1464,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I did not know that.,01:51:00,Volker/Morrison
1465,Section_1,Denny Heck,"It’s true, because he thought we should start with himself. I raise this because my friends on the other side of the aisle keep characterizing this impeachment inquiry as inherently wrong because, and I’m quoting them, “it will overturn an election, over and over it will overturn an election”. Well impeachment is an anti-corruption tool and for my friends on the other side of the aisle, yes, it does overturn an election. By definition it overturns an election. I don’t know if they’ve got a problem with our constitution and its provisions for impeachment, but I recommend they reread the relevant passages in article one, sections two and three and some of the history about how we got there. Look, none of us wants to be here despite what’s being said. None of us came to this easily. I didn’t. Where a call for the rest of my life, the 48 hours I spent at our family cabin literally plunged in self reflection and literally prayerful deliberation about this whole matter.",01:51:01,Volker/Morrison
1466,Section_1,Denny Heck,"Collectively, we are going to have to grapple with this very grave decision. It’s waiting and it’s going to get hard, and it’s hard in proportion to its importance to our great Republic. A Republic, if we can keep it. I yield back Mr. Chairman.",01:52:05,Volker/Morrison
1467,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Jordan.,01:52:32,Volker/Morrison
1468,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Volker in the now famous call transcript, the bottom of page three president Trump said this, “I heard you had a prosecutor and he was shut down and that’s really unfair”. Just for clarification, do you believe President Trump was talking about Lutsenko or Shoken?",01:52:33,Volker/Morrison
1469,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Shoken.,01:52:48,Volker/Morrison
1470,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Shoken, all right, thank you so much. That’s what I thought as well. Mr. Morrison, you testified in your deposition that you had issues with Colonel Vindman’s judgment. Is that right?",01:52:49,Volker/Morrison
1471,Section_1,Tim Morrison,It is sir.,01:52:58,Volker/Morrison
1472,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"And you said specifically that you had concerns with Colonel Vindman exercising, “appropriate judgment as to whom he said what”, is that right?",01:52:59,Volker/Morrison
1473,Section_1,Tim Morrison,It is sir.,01:53:07,Volker/Morrison
1474,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"You testified that Dr. Hill, your predecessor at NSC told you that she had concerns about Colonel Vindman’s judgment. Is that right?",01:53:07,Volker/Morrison
1475,Section_1,Tim Morrison,It is sir.,01:53:14,Volker/Morrison
1476,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"And you testified that Colonel Vindman did not always adhere to the chain of command, is that right?",01:53:15,Volker/Morrison
1477,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I believe so, yes sir.",01:53:20,Volker/Morrison
1478,Section_1,Jim Jordan,You testified that you were aware of issues with Colonel Vindman trying to access information outside his lane. Is that correct?,01:53:21,Volker/Morrison
1479,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I believe I stated that I was aware that there were those who were concerned about that yesterday.",01:53:26,Volker/Morrison
1480,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Okay, thank you. You testify that Colonel Vindman was not included on certain trips, is that right?",01:53:31,Volker/Morrison
1481,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes sir.,01:53:35,Volker/Morrison
1482,Section_1,Jim Jordan,And you testified that colleagues express concerns to you about Colonel Vindman leaking information. Is that right?,01:53:36,Volker/Morrison
1483,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, sir.",01:53:44,Volker/Morrison
1484,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Now when I asked Colonel Vindman why he didn’t go to you with his concerns about the call, even though you, his boss, had no concerns about anything being, I think your language was nothing improper, nothing illegal on the call. I asked Colonel Vindman earlier this morning why he didn’t go to you and instead went and talked to the lawyers, his brother, Secretary Kent, and one other person that he wouldn’t tell us and Chairman Schiff wouldn’t allow him to tell us. When I asked him why he did that, he indicated that the lawyers had instructed him to do that and he tried to get ahold of you. Is that fair?",01:53:46,Volker/Morrison
1485,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I watched part of the proceedings this morning. I heard him say that. Yes sir.",01:54:22,Volker/Morrison
1486,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Okay. Well, one thing that Chairman Schiff brought up at the end of this morning’s hearing, he said, he pointed out that you, Colonel Vindman’s boss, also went to the lawyers, but your reason for going to the lawyers was a little different, wasn’t it?",01:54:26,Volker/Morrison
1487,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes sir.,01:54:40,Volker/Morrison
1488,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Yeah. I think you had a few things that Mr. Caster and you talked about earlier in today’s hearing, but I think at the top of your list was you were concerned about the contents of the call leaking out. Is that fair?",01:54:40,Volker/Morrison
1489,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes sir.,01:54:54,Volker/Morrison
1490,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"And that’s exactly what happened, isn’t it?",01:54:56,Volker/Morrison
1491,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I don’t know that the contents leaked out. There was a whistleblower complaint. The President chose to declassify the memcon.",01:55:00,Volker/Morrison
1492,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"Well, it seems to me you were prophetic, Mr. Morrison, because you said in your statement today, “as I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how the disclosure of the contents of the call would play in Washington’s political climate. My fears have been realized”. It seems to me you saw what might happen and it sure enough did, fair to say?",01:55:12,Volker/Morrison
1493,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes sir.,01:55:39,Volker/Morrison
1494,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"And we get all this and that’s the part that gets me, we get all this, these hearings, these weeks, basement and the bunker in the basement of the Capitol and four facts that we keep coming back to have never changed. Will never change. We’ve heard from both of you today. I confirmed these fundamental facts.",01:55:40,Volker/Morrison
1495,Section_1,Jim Jordan,"We’ve got the call transcript as you’ve both said, no linkage to security assistance dollars and investigations in the call transcript. We’ve got the two individuals who were on the call, they’ve both said no linkage, no pressure, no pushing. We’ve got the fact that the Ukrainians didn’t even know aid had been withheld until August 29th and most importantly the Ukrainians did nothing as far as starting, promising to start, announcing they were going to start investigation, did nothing and the aid got released. And I believe it got released because of what we’ve been talking about. The good work of Ambassador Volker and others. I believe that’s why it happened and yet here we are. And you called it all. You saw this coming, that’s why you went to the lawyers. That’s why the concern was there and that’s the part that’s most troubling. I yield back Mr. Chairman. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.",01:56:03,Volker/Morrison
1496,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Ambassador Volker on Daily Mail they currently have this headline. It says Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker walks back his closed door testimony and says he “has now learned there was a link between U.S. military aid and a Biden probe”. That’s not your testimony today, is it?",01:57:03,Volker/Morrison
1497,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I don’t believe that’s in my testimony.,01:57:21,Volker/Morrison
1498,Section_1,Michael Turner,"Thank you, I yield back.",01:57:23,Volker/Morrison
1499,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Welch.,01:57:27,Volker/Morrison
1500,Section_1,Peter Welch,Thank you. Just following up on Mr. Jordan. Easiest way to avoid investigation is to not do anything wrong. I want to talk a little bit about why we’re here. Official government actions can’t be traded for help in a political campaign. Let me give an analogy and ask each of you if you agree. Could a mayor of a city withhold funding for the police department budget unless the police chief agreed to open up an investigation on a political rival. Mr. Morrison?,01:57:30,Volker/Morrison
1501,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"In that hypothetical, no I don’t think he should do that.",01:58:07,Volker/Morrison
1502,Section_1,Peter Welch,"Yeah. And Ambassador Volker, I’m sure you agree?",01:58:12,Volker/Morrison
1503,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:58:16,Volker/Morrison
1504,Section_1,Peter Welch,And the same would be true if it were a governor withholding the budget request of the state police unless the state police agreed to conduct an investigation on a political rival. You would agree?,01:58:17,Volker/Morrison
1505,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,01:58:29,Volker/Morrison
1506,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes sir.,01:58:30,Volker/Morrison
1507,Section_1,Peter Welch,"In your view is it any different for a member of Congress? Of course not, right? Would you agree that the President has the same obligation as the Mayor, as the Governor, as the member of Congress to not withhold aid unless he gets an investigation into a political rival? Mr. Morrison?",01:58:31,Volker/Morrison
1508,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Yes sir. I would agree with that hypothetical.,01:58:56,Volker/Morrison
1509,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I would agree.,01:58:58,Volker/Morrison
1510,Section_1,Peter Welch,"Thanks. And we’re having a debate here, both sides as to how to read what’s plainly before us, the presidential phone call where the President ignored the work of the advisors and the national security council of talking points, and instead chose to talk about the Bidens and talk about Hunter Biden and asked for an investigation. So we are just going to have to debate that. But isn’t the principle that no person, including the President is above the law, absolutely essential and worth the effort to make certain that we continue to guarantee? Ambassador Morrison.",01:58:59,Volker/Morrison
1511,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Sir, I haven’t been promoted-",01:59:45,Volker/Morrison
1512,Section_1,Peter Welch,"I’m sorry, Ambassador Volker. I’m sorry. Pardon me.",01:59:46,Volker/Morrison
1513,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,01:59:49,Volker/Morrison
1514,Section_1,Peter Welch,"Yeah, and Mr. Morrison?",01:59:50,Volker/Morrison
1515,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Sir the rule of law is central to our democracy.,01:59:52,Volker/Morrison
1516,Section_1,Peter Welch,"It’s so true. And you know, we’ve had some discussions and challenge from the other side that the President has …",01:59:55,Volker/Morrison
1517,Section_1,Peter Welch,"Challenge from the other side that the President has authority in foreign policy to do what he likes. And in fact, he does. A recent president, by President Trump to take our troops out of Syria and allow the Turkish forces to go in literally meant that some Kurdish families went to bed Saturday night and woke up Sunday morning, packed their kids and fled for their lives. A lot of people, including both sides of the aisle totally disagreed with that, but the President has the authority to do it, impulsive as that decision may have been, unwise as it may have been, as threatening to our national security.",02:00:03,Volker/Morrison
1518,Section_1,Peter Welch,"We’re not talking about that here. And Ambassador Volker, I’ve listened to your testimony and I take it and thank you for making efforts to try to advance what had been a bi-partisan Ukraine policy, help Ukraine get rid of corruption, help resist Russian aggression. But what you came to learn painfully is that there was a sidebar Ukraine policy with Giuliani as the advocate and it appears Ambassador Sondland is very much involved. Is that correct?",02:00:48,Volker/Morrison
1519,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I don’t know everything about that, sir.",02:01:22,Volker/Morrison
1520,Section_1,Peter Welch,"You don’t, but as you have been involved and with the benefit of hindsight, while you were working on what you thought was stopping aggression and eliminating corruption, there was a side deal here to get investigations going, correct?",02:01:24,Volker/Morrison
1521,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yeah. So, yes, sir. My objective was purely focused on support for Ukraine. National security and I now have learned through other testimony about the President’s statement, about investigating Biden, and other conversations that I did not know about.",02:01:39,Volker/Morrison
1522,Section_1,Peter Welch,"Right, and thank you for that and thank you for your candor about Vice President’s Biden integrity and service. But the bottom line here is that at the end of the day, we’re going to have to make a judgment about what the President was up to with respect to that request for the favor and how it repudiated the policy that was the bi-partisan effort in Ukraine and raises questions about he in that hypothetical example I gave of the mayor, held himself to be above the law. I yield back.",02:01:56,Volker/Morrison
1523,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Maloney?,02:02:34,Volker/Morrison
1524,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"Gentlemen, thank you for being here. Ambassador Volker, I was struck by your opening statement. You moved a long way from the testimony you presented to us in October and I know you gave a reason for that, which is that you were in the dark about a lot of these things. Is that fair to say?",02:02:35,Volker/Morrison
1525,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is one thing that I learned a lot our of the testimony of others.,02:02:57,Volker/Morrison
1526,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"You learned a lot. You learned a lot, and what you said on page eight, I’m referring to your statement that you gave this morning… Excuse me, this afternoon. “That I did not know,” this is quoting, “I did not know that President Trump or others had raised Vice President Biden with the Ukrainians or had conflated the investigation of possible Ukrainian corruption with investigation of the former Vice President Biden.” Right?",02:03:00,Volker/Morrison
1527,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,02:03:23,Volker/Morrison
1528,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"You didn’t know Burisma meant Biden, that’s what you’re saying?",02:03:24,Volker/Morrison
1529,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Right, I had separated the two.",02:03:26,Volker/Morrison
1530,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"I got it. Well, you didn’t know, right? I mean, you were… Well, do we have to go through it, sir? I mean, you were there on May 23rd for the meeting with the President when he said, “Talk to Rudy,” and Rudy sure cared about the investigations, which you now know meant Biden, right? But you missed it on May 23rd, right?",02:03:28,Volker/Morrison
1531,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, sir. I understood at the time that Hunter Biden, Vice President Biden’s son, had been a board member of Burisma.",02:03:45,Volker/Morrison
1532,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"I understand, but you didn’t read that as a request to investigate the Bidens at that time?",02:03:54,Volker/Morrison
1533,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,02:03:58,Volker/Morrison
1534,Section_1,Sean Maloney,That’s all I’m saying.,02:03:58,Volker/Morrison
1535,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,02:03:59,Volker/Morrison
1536,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"And on July 10th, you were in not one but two meetings in the White House where Ambassador Sondland raised the investigations, but you didn’t know it was about the Bidens, that’s your testimony, right? At the time?",02:03:59,Volker/Morrison
1537,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That’s right. I did not think he was talking about anything specific.,02:04:09,Volker/Morrison
1538,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"Right. You heard him say investigations, you thought it was inappropriate, and the Chairman asked you about that, but you said, “Oh, it’s because I didn’t know it was the Bidens, I just thought it was inappropriate,” and then I guess when they were in the war room and Ambassador Sondland raised Burisma and the Bidens in 2016, you missed that too, as I understand it?",02:04:11,Volker/Morrison
1539,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,02:04:28,Volker/Morrison
1540,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"Right, and then of curse on July 18th, you knew aid was withheld, and then in August, you spent a good part of the time with this statement with Rudy Giuliani, right? I mean, you were the guy making the changes and interacting with the Ukrainians. You were putting in Rudy’s changes, which included a call for investigating Burisma and the 2016 elections, which you now know meant Bidens, right? You didn’t know at at the time, right? But now we know it, right? And then on September 1st, you were in Warsaw. I mean, you were at every point in this. You were in Warsaw and you were there when Ambassador Sondland told Andrey Yermak that he was not going to get security assistance, he wasn’t going to get a White House meeting unless there was the investigation and I understand you missed that, you were out of the loop then?",02:04:29,Volker/Morrison
1541,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"That’s not correct, sir. So I was not in Warsaw at these meetings.",02:05:14,Volker/Morrison
1542,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"Oh, excuse me, you were not in Warsaw, but you heard about it right after from Sondland, is that right?",02:05:17,Volker/Morrison
1543,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, that’s not quite correct either. It was sometime later.",02:05:21,Volker/Morrison
1544,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"I got it. So, but now we know, right? Now you know what it meant, and you said, “In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.”",02:05:24,Volker/Morrison
1545,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Right, that is correct, and [crosstalk 02:05:37]-",02:05:35,Volker/Morrison
1546,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"What are the objections you would have raised, sir?",02:05:37,Volker/Morrison
1547,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"What I would have raised is that people are conflating investigating the Bidens with investigating this Ukrainian company, Burisma-",02:05:41,Volker/Morrison
1548,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"But would you have objected to the President asking for an investigation of the Bidens? As you sit here now, you said, “I would have raised my own objections.”",02:05:46,Volker/Morrison
1549,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Yes.,02:05:55,Volker/Morrison
1550,Section_1,Sean Maloney,If you knew it was the Bidens?,02:05:56,Volker/Morrison
1551,Section_1,Kurt Volker,If I knew we were talking about investigating Vice President Biden and asking the Ukrainians to do that-,02:05:57,Volker/Morrison
1552,Section_1,Sean Maloney,And his son.,02:06:02,Volker/Morrison
1553,Section_1,Kurt Volker,… that would be inappropriate and I would have objected to that.,02:06:03,Volker/Morrison
1554,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"Right. And so if you had heard him ask for it on the call, and you said, “In retrospect, Ukrainians clearly would have been… It would have been confusing,” right?",02:06:06,Volker/Morrison
1555,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,02:06:14,Volker/Morrison
1556,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"Is confusing the right word, sir? I mean, it would have put them in the position of having to do something inappropriate, right?",02:06:15,Volker/Morrison
1557,Section_1,Kurt Volker,No.,02:06:20,Volker/Morrison
1558,Section_1,Sean Maloney,Investigate the Bidens?,02:06:20,Volker/Morrison
1559,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I think confusing’s the right word because they were clearly hearing something different from the President in one conversation and different from me as a US Special Representative, different from Bill Taylor on the [crosstalk 02:06:33]-",02:06:21,Volker/Morrison
1560,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"Well maybe sir, they understood that investigating Burisma and investigating 2016 in fact meant the Bidens even though you didn’t? I mean, at the time you were talking to Yermak and putting those changes in the statement, he had talked to Sondland, right? At the same time. And so the point being that they were put in an impossible position. They were being asked to do something inappropriate, and you now know that, right? And you would have raised your own objections?",02:06:33,Volker/Morrison
1561,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Well, I know they were asked in the phone call to do that, in the conversations that I had with the Ukrainians, we were not asking them to do that. And even at that point, the Ukrainians, perhaps with the knowledge of this phone call, which I did not have knowledge of at the time, is that we just don’t want to go there.",02:06:59,Volker/Morrison
1562,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"Right, so in retrospect though, you would have raised objections. You would have said it was inappropriate-",02:07:15,Volker/Morrison
1563,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,02:07:20,Volker/Morrison
1564,Section_1,Sean Maloney,… to do this?,02:07:22,Volker/Morrison
1565,Section_1,Kurt Volker,Correct.,02:07:22,Volker/Morrison
1566,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"And Mr. Morrison, can I just ask you, sir, so I’m stuck on this issue of you didn’t see anything wrong with the call, but you went straight to NSC legal to report it. Is that your testimony to us today?",02:07:23,Volker/Morrison
1567,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, sir.",02:07:35,Volker/Morrison
1568,Section_1,Sean Maloney,"Thank you, sir. Yield back.",02:07:37,Volker/Morrison

1570,Section_1,Val Demings,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Morrison, and to both of you, thank you so much for your service. Thanks for being here, it’s been a long day. Mr. Morrison, just to follow up on the question from my colleague, you responded earlier to a series of questions about the call and basically saw nothing wrong with it, yet you skipped your chain of command to go to legal counsel to find out, I guess to find out what to do because you were concerned about the political fall out, not about anything being inappropriate or wrong with the call? Is that correct?",02:07:41,Volker/Morrison
1571,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Ma’am, I don’t agree with the premise, no.",02:08:18,Volker/Morrison
1572,Section_1,Val Demings,"Okay, could you tell me why you felt the need? You saw nothing basically wrong with the call, yet you skipped your chain of command to go to counsel, because of what? What was the reason for that?",02:08:19,Volker/Morrison
1573,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Again, I don’t agree with the premise, ma’am. I don’t think I did skip my chain of command. If I had seen something wrong, I would have-",02:08:35,Volker/Morrison

1577,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Dr. Charles Cupperman, at the time.",02:08:48,Volker/Morrison
1578,Section_1,Val Demings,"Okay, Dr. Cupperman. Did you speak with him before you spoke with legal counsel?",02:08:49,Volker/Morrison
1579,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"No. No, ma’am.",02:08:53,Volker/Morrison
1580,Section_1,Val Demings,"But you don’t feel you skipped your chain of command in doing so, going directly to counsel?",02:08:54,Volker/Morrison
1581,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Ma’am, if I may, I viewed my engagement with the NSC legal advisor as one largely focused on administrative matters. I was interested in locking down the transcript, that’s an administrative matter. I was interested in making sure that the legal advisor was aware of the call, because I didn’t see anybody from the legal advisor’s office [crosstalk 02:09:20]-",02:09:00,Volker/Morrison
1582,Section_1,Val Demings,And why were you so concerned about the legal advisor being aware of this call that you saw nothing basically wrong with the substance or content of the call?,02:09:20,Volker/Morrison
1583,Section_1,Tim Morrison,Because I did not see anybody from the legal advisor’s office in the listening room and I wanted to make sure somebody from the legal advisor’s office was aware and I wanted to make sure it was a senior person.,02:09:31,Volker/Morrison
1584,Section_1,Val Demings,"And what is it that you wanted them to be aware of, specifically?",02:09:41,Volker/Morrison
1585,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"I wanted them to be aware of the call, because I wanted to know what had transpired.",02:09:44,Volker/Morrison
1586,Section_1,Val Demings,What concerned you to the point where you wanted them to know what had transpired that you went directly to legal counsel to inform them of?,02:09:52,Volker/Morrison
1587,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"My equivalent, the head of NSC legal, was and is John Eisenberg. He was my equivalent in that position. I wouldn’t go to somebody subordinate to him, I would go to him to express my concerns [crosstalk 02:10:14].",02:10:03,Volker/Morrison
1588,Section_1,Val Demings,Didn’t you testify earlier that you were concerned about the political fall out based on the political climate in DC? Is that-,02:10:14,Volker/Morrison
1589,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Yes, ma’am. Yes, ma’am.",02:10:23,Volker/Morrison
1590,Section_1,Val Demings,"Okay, all right. And so how long have you supervised Lieutenant Colonel Vindman?",02:10:24,Volker/Morrison
1591,Section_1,Tim Morrison,"Ma’am, approximately… Well, I guess not approximately. July 15 to October 31 or so.",02:10:30,Volker/Morrison
1592,Section_1,Val Demings,"Okay. All right, thank you. Ambassador Volker, you testified that you believe that Congressional pressure helped unfreeze the security assistance being released. Do you still stand by that testimony today?",02:10:36,Volker/Morrison
1593,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I believe it was important. I met with the staff members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I then saw the letter that several Senators signed and sent to Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and I was briefed about the possibility of some phone calls from some senior members of the Senate as well.",02:10:51,Volker/Morrison
1594,Section_1,Val Demings,"Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield my remaining time to you.",02:11:08,Volker/Morrison
1595,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Ambassador Volker, just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions about Ukrainians not being aware of the aid being withheld. You’re aware, I’m sure, of the testimony of Colonel Vindman that in fact, he was contacted by someone within the Ukrainian Embassy who was concerned about the whole prior to it becoming public?",02:11:11,Volker/Morrison
1596,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"I was not aware of that, but I take that.",02:11:36,Volker/Morrison
1597,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Are you aware of Ms. Croft’s testimony and transcripts that have been released that in fact, Ukrainians found out quite quickly after the hold was placed in July, that she was impressed with Ukrainian trade craft, and that the Ukrainians had a reason to keep it silent and not make it public?",02:11:39,Volker/Morrison
1598,Section_1,Kurt Volker,I saw that in her testimony.,02:11:55,Volker/Morrison
1599,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"You don’t have any reason to question whether in fact that testimony was accurate, do you?",02:11:57,Volker/Morrison
1600,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"No, I don’t.",02:12:01,Volker/Morrison
1601,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"So the Ukrainians did find out before it was public, at least according to these two witnesses, but nevertheless, the Ukrainians certainly found out it was public when it was published in the newspaper, right?",02:12:02,Volker/Morrison
1602,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"That is correct, on August 29th.",02:12:15,Volker/Morrison
1603,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And at the time they found out from the newspaper, they still hadn’t had the White House meeting and they still didn’t have the aid, and at that point, they had already had the conversation with the President in which he asked them to investigate the Bidens, correct?",02:12:17,Volker/Morrison
1604,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,02:12:36,Volker/Morrison
1605,Section_1,Adam Schiff,Mr. Krishnamoorthi?,02:12:42,Volker/Morrison
1606,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"Good evening to both of you, and thank you for your service. Ambassador Volker, on page seven of your opening statement today, you said since events surrounding your earlier testimony, October 3rd, “A great deal of additional information, perspectives have come to light. I have learned many things that I did not know at the time or the events in question.” Correct?",02:12:47,Volker/Morrison
1607,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, that is correct.",02:13:12,Volker/Morrison

1612,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"You were not aware that Ambassador Sondland, according to your opening statement, had a call with President Trump on July 26th, correct?",02:13:29,Volker/Morrison

1614,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"On September 1st, you weren’t present for the sidebar meeting between Ambassador Sondland and Special Advisor Yermak, isn’t that right?",02:13:38,Volker/Morrison
1615,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,02:13:48,Volker/Morrison
1616,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"And you certainly weren’t part of the phone call between Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Sondland in which Ambassador Sondland, according to multiple people now, said that everything, a White House meeting as well as military aid were dependent on public announcements of investigations. Isn’t that right?",02:13:50,Volker/Morrison
1617,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,02:14:14,Volker/Morrison
1618,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"And certainly sir, you weren’t part of the phone call on September 7th between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump, in which President Trump insisted that President Zelensky go to a mic and publicly announce investigations of President Trump’s domestic rivals, isn’t that right?",02:14:15,Volker/Morrison
1619,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,02:14:32,Volker/Morrison
1620,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"And certainly, you weren’t part of the September 8th phone call between Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador… I’m sorry, President Trump, where President Trump again insists that these announcements have to happen, isn’t that right?",02:14:33,Volker/Morrison

1622,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"Sir, you say that you weren’t a witness to any kind of quid pro quo or conditionality between military assistance and investigations, what someone called missiles for misinformation today, isn’t that right?",02:14:50,Volker/Morrison
1623,Section_1,Kurt Volker,That is correct.,02:15:05,Volker/Morrison
1624,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"But sir, you weren’t present for many, if not all of the phone calls and conversations where these alleged instances of quid pro quo occurred, isn’t that right?",02:15:06,Volker/Morrison

1626,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"Sir, let me turn your attention to another topic that’s come up today. Or actually, it came up last Friday. You have high regard for Ambassador Yovanovitch, correct?",02:15:20,Volker/Morrison
1627,Section_1,Kurt Volker,"Yes, I do.",02:15:33,Volker/Morrison
1628,Section_1,Raja Krishnamoorthi,"I presume that you were aware that as the Ambassador was testifying, President Trump actually tweeted very disparaging remarks about her, right?",02:15:35,Volker/Morrison

1654,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Thank you. As the first day of this week’s impeachment TV marathon draws to a close, I’d like to remind the American people what we’re watching. The public hearings are the culmination of three years of incessant Democrat efforts to find a crime to impeach the President. First, they tried to manufacture evidence that the President colluded with Russia. To accomplish this task, the DNC and the Clinton Campaign worked with a former British spy, Christopher Steele. Steele assembled a dossier of false information, alleging the Trump Campaign colluded with Russia.",02:17:40,Volker/Morrison
1655,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"That dossier was largely assembled from Russian and Ukrainian sources that the Democrat contractors worked with. Next, they primed their hopes on the work of Robert Mueller. Mueller spent two years and millions of taxpayer dollars seeking evidence of a crime that we know wasn’t committed. Mueller’s failure was a devastating blow to Democrats, who clearly hoped his work to be the basis for the removal of the President. Today, we are witnessing the Ukraine hoax, the direct-to-TV sequel to the Russia collusion hoax. The plot of the Ukraine hoax is hard to follow. It shifts from day to day. First, the Democrats claim they had evidence of quid pro quo, then extortion and witness intimidation. Now, Democrats are pinning their hopes on bribery. Like any good Hollywood production, Democrats needed a screen test before releasing their latest attack on the President. They leveraged the secrecy of the House Intelligence Committee to interview a cast of characters in preparation for these public hearings.",02:18:16,Volker/Morrison
1656,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"With the media’s enthusiastic support, they built a narrative abased on selectively leaked testimony. Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats on this committee are seeking the truth, they would want to know the answers to the following questions that they refuse to ask. To what extent did the whistleblower coordinate with the Democrats on this committee, and/or his staff? What is the full extent of Ukraine’s election meddling against the Trump Campaign in 2016? Why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden, and what did he do for them, and did his position impact any US government actions under the Obama administration?",02:19:26,Volker/Morrison
1657,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"The American people were promised a grave and somber impeachment inquiry, instead they got the salacious spy screen comedy that they’ve been working on for three years. Good night, see you in the morning.",02:20:05,Volker/Morrison
1658,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"I thank the gentleman, and I thank you both for your testimony today. I would highlight a couple things about what we’ve heard this afternoon. First, Ambassador Volker, your written testimony in which you say, “In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company Burisma as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different; the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable. In retrospect,” you said, “I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.”",02:20:23,Volker/Morrison
1659,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador, we appreciate your willingness to amend your earlier testimony in light of what you now know. I think you’ve made it very clear that knowing what you do today, that in fact the President sought an investigation of his political rival, Vice President Biden, that you would not have countenanced any effort to encourage the Ukrainians to engage in such conduct. I appreciate also that you were able to debunk, I hope for the last time, the idea that Joe Biden did something wrong when he, in accordance with US policy, sought to replace a corrupt prosecutor, something that not only the US State Department wanted, not only the European Union wanted, and not only the IMF wanted, but was the consensus position of the United States’ national security infrastructure.",02:21:11,Volker/Morrison
1660,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"You didn’t get a lot of questions about that today as other witnesses did because I think you effectively said, “That was all nonsense.” We appreciate your candor about that. Mr. Morrison, I think what is most remarkable about your testimony is the acknowledgement that immediately after the Vice President met with President Zelensky in Warsaw, you witnessed Gordon Sondland meeting with Andrey Yermak, a top advisor to President Zelensky. And then immediately thereafter, Sondland told you that he had informed the Ukrainians that if they wanted that $400 million in military aid, they were going to have to do those investigations that the President wanted. You were later informed and this is also significant as you’ve testified here today, that the Ambassador Sondland had a subsequent conversation with President Trump and informed you that it wasn’t going to be enough for the Ukrainian Prosecutor General to announce the investigations the President wanted.",02:22:06,Volker/Morrison
1661,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"President Zelensky had to do it himself if he wanted to get that aid, let alone the meeting in the White House. Now, you’ve been asked to opine on the meaning of the term bribery, although you weren’t asked to opine on the meaning of the terms high crimes and misdemeanors. But bribery for those watching at home is the conditioning of official acts in exchange for something of personal value. The official acts we’re talking about here are a White House meeting that President Zelensky desperately sought and as you have acknowledged Ambassador Volker, was deeply important to this country at war with Russia, to show the United States had this new president’s back. That meeting was important. That meeting is an official act. The military assistance is even more significant, because Ukrainians are dying every day in their war with Russia.",02:23:07,Volker/Morrison
1662,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"So the withholding of military assistance to get these investigations which you now have acknowledged, Ambassador Volker, was wrong for the President to request, the idea of withholding that military aid to get these political investigations should be anathema, repugnant to every American because it means the sacrifice not just of Ukrainian national security, but American national security for the interests of the President personally and politically. Now, my Republican colleagues, all they seem to be upset about with this is not that the President sought an investigation of his political rival, not that he withheld a White House meeting and $400 million in aid we all passed on a bi-partisan basis to pressure Ukraine to do those investigations. Their objection is he got caught. Their objection is that someone blew the whistle, and they would like this whistleblower identified, and the President wants this whistleblower punished. That’s their objection, not that the President engaged in this conduct but that he got caught. Their defense is, “Well, he ended up releasing the aid.” Yes, after he got caught! That doesn’t make this any less odious. Americans may be watching this and asking, “Why should the United States care about Ukraine? Why should we care about Ukraine?” And this was the import, I think of the conversation, the now infamous conversation in that Kiev restaurant with Gordon Sondland holding the phone away from his head because the President was talking so loud. What does the President ask in that call the day after the now infamous call he had with Zelensky? What does he ask on that cell phone call?",02:24:09,Volker/Morrison
1663,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Not whether the Rada had passed some new anti-corruption reform, no. Are the Ukrainians going to do the investigation, meaning into Biden? And Sondland’s answer is, “They’re going to do it, they’ll do essentially anything the President wants.” Well, what’s more telling is the conversation, I think that Sondland has with the Foreign Service Officer Holmes afterwards, in which the President says basically, “Donald Trump doesn’t give an explitave about Ukraine.” He cares about the big things, and Mr. Holmes says, “Well, Ukraine’s at war with the Russians, that’s kind of a big thing.” And Sondland’s answer is, “No, no. He cares about big things that affect his personal interests.”",02:25:54,Volker/Morrison
1664,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"This is why Americans should care about this. And Americans should care about what happens to our allies who are dying, but America should care about their own national security and their own president and their own Constitution. And they will need to ask themselves as we will have to ask ourselves in Congress, are we prepared to accept that a President of the United States can leverage official acts, military assistance, White House meetings to get an investigation of a political rival. Are we prepared to say, “Well, I guess that’s just what we expect out of the President of the United States.” I don’t think we want to go there. I don’t think our founding fathers would have wanted us to go there.",02:26:43,Volker/Morrison
1665,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Indeed, I think when the founding fathers provided a remedy, that remedy being impeachment, they had the very concern that a President of the United States may betray the national security interests of the country for personal interests. They put that remedy in the Constitution, not because they wanted to willy-nilly overturn elections. No, because they wanted a powerful anti-corruption mechanism when that corruption came from the highest office in the land. We are adjourned. I ask the audience to please allow the witnesses to leave the room before they exit.",02:27:28,Volker/Morrison
0,Section_0,Gordon Sondland,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak again to the members of this committee. First, let me offer my thanks to the men and women of the US Department of State, who have committed their professional lives to support the foreign policy work of the United States. In particular, I want to thank my staff at the US Mission to the European Union. Your integrity, dedication, and hard work often performed without public acclaim or recognition serve as a shining example of true public service. And I am personally grateful to work beside you each and every day.",00:00,Sondland
1,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"It is my honor to serve as the US Ambassador to the European Union. The US Mission to the EU is the direct link between the United States and the European Union and its members. America’s longest standing allies and one of the largest economic blocks in the world. Every day I work to support a strong, united and peaceful Europe. Strengthening our ties with Europe serves both American and European goals as we together promote political stability and economic prosperity around the world.",00:44,Sondland
2,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"I expect that few Americans have heard my name before these events. So before I begin my substantive testimony, please let me share some of my personal background. My parents fled Europe during the Holocaust. Escaping the atrocities of that time, my parents left Germany for Uruguay and then in 1953 emigrated to Seattle, Washington, where I was born and raised. Like so many immigrants, my family was eager for freedom and hungry for opportunity. They raised my sister and me to be humble, hardworking and patriotic and I am forever grateful for the sacrifices they made on our behalf.",01:24,Sondland
3,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Public service has always been important to me. As a lifelong Republican, I have contributed to initiatives of both Republican and Democratic administrations. In 2003, I served as a member of the transition team for Oregon Democratic Governor Ted Kulongoski. Governor Kulongoski also appointed me to serve on various statewide boards. In 2007, President George W. Bush appointed me as a member of the Commission on White House Fellows. I worked with President Bush on charitable events for his foundation’s military service initiative. And I also worked briefly with former Vice President Joe Biden’s office in connection with the vice president’s nationwide anti-cancer initiative at a local Northwest hospital.",02:12,Sondland
4,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"And of course the highest honor in my public life came when President Trump asked me to serve as the United States Ambassador to the European Union. The Senate confirmed me as an ambassador on a bipartisan voice vote and I assumed the role in Brussels on July 9th, 2018. Although today is my first public testimony on the Ukraine matters, this is not my first time cooperating with this committee. As you know, I’ve already provided 10 hours of deposition testimony. And I did so despite directives from the White House and the State Department that I refused to appear as many others have done. I agreed to testify because I respect the gravity of the moment and I believe I have an obligation to account fully for my role in these events.",03:07,Sondland
5,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"But I also must acknowledge that this process has been challenging. And in many respects, less than fair. I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails and many, many other State Department documents. And I was told I could not work with my EU staff to pull together the relevant files and information. Having access to the State Department materials would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.",04:06,Sondland
6,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"As ambassador, I’ve had hundreds of meetings and calls with individuals, but I’m not a note taker or a memo writer. Never have been. My job requires that I speak with heads of state, senior government officials, members of the cabinet, the president almost each and every day. Talking with foreign leaders might be memorable to some people, but this is my job. I do it all the time. My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State Department and the White House for these materials. Yet these materials were not provided to me and they have also refused to share these materials with this committee. These documents are not classified. And in fairness should have been made available.",04:43,Sondland
7,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"In the absence of these materials, my memory, admittedly, has not been perfect. And I have no doubt that a more fair, open and orderly process of allowing me to read the State Department records and other materials would have made this process far more transparent. I don’t intend to repeat my prior opening statement or attempt to summarize 10 hours of previous deposition testimony. However, a few critical points have been obscured by noise over the last few days and weeks and I’m worried that the bigger picture is being ignored. So let me make a few key points.",05:41,Sondland
8,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"First, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States. We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refuse to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.",06:25,Sondland
9,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Second, although we disagreed with the need to involve Mr. Giuliani at the time, we did not believe that his role was improper. As I previously testified, if I had known of all of Mr. Giuliani’s dealings or his associations with individuals, some of whom are now under criminal indictment, I personally would not have acquiesced to his participation. Still, given what we knew at the time, what we were asked to do did not appear to be wrong.",07:07,Sondland
10,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Third, let me say precisely because we did not think that we were engaging in improper behavior, we made every effort to ensure that the relevant decision makers at the National Security Council and the State Department knew the important details of our efforts. The suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false. I have now identified certain State Department emails and messages that provide contemporaneous support for my view. These emails show that the leadership of the State Department, the National Security Council, and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts from May 23rd, 2019 until the security aid was released on September 11th, 2019. I will quote from some of those messages with shortly.",07:44,Sondland
11,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Fourth, as I testified previously, Mr. Giuliani’s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing the investigations of the 2016 election, DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States and we knew these investigations were important to the president.",08:58,Sondland
12,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Fifth, in July and August of 2019, we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I was adamantly opposed to any suspension of aid. I was adamantly opposed to any suspension of aid as the Ukrainians needed those funds to fight against Russian aggression. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. Still haven’t to this day. In the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma as Mr. Giuliani had demanded. I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson and I also shared my concerns with the Ukrainians.",09:37,Sondland
13,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Finally, at all times, I was acting in good faith. I was acting in good faith. As a presidential appointee, I followed the directions of the president. We worked with Mr. Giuliani because the president directed us to do so. We had no desire to set any conditions. We had no desire to set any conditions on the Ukrainians. Indeed, my own personal view, which I shared repeatedly with others, was that the White House and security assistance should have proceeded without preconditions of any kind. We were working to overcome the problems given the facts as they existed. Our only interest, and my only interest, was to advance longstanding US policy and to support Ukraine’s fragile democracy.",10:51,Sondland
14,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Now let me provide additional details specifically about Ukraine and my involvement. First, my very first days as ambassador to the EU, which was starting back in July of 2018, Ukraine has featured prominently in my broader portfolio. Ukraine’s political and economic development are critical to the long standing and long lasting stability of Europe. Moreover, the conflict in eastern Ukraine and Crimea remains one of the most significant security crisis for Europe and the United States. Our efforts to counterbalance an aggressive Russia depend in substantial part on a strong Ukraine.",11:54,Sondland
15,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"On April 21st, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine in an historic election. With the expressed support of Secretary Pompeo, I attended President Zelensky’s inauguration on May 20th as part of the US delegation, which was led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The US delegation also included Senator Johnson, Ukraine special envoy Volker and Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vindman of the National Security Council.",12:46,Sondland
16,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"My attendance at President Zelensky’s inauguration was not my first involvement with Ukraine. As I testified previously, just four days after assuming my post as ambassador in July of 2018, I received an official delegation from the government of then Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko. The meeting took place at the US Mission in Brussels and was prearranged by my career EU Mission staff. And I’ve had several meetings since then in Brussels. Later in February of 2019, I worked well with US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in making my first official visit to Ukraine for a US Navy visit to the strategic Black Sea port of Odessa.",13:24,Sondland
17,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"And the reason I raise these prior Ukraine activities, the meetings in Brussels, my visit to Odessa, is to emphasize that Ukraine has been a part of my portfolio from my very first days as the US Ambassador. Any claim that I somehow muscled my way into the Ukraine relationship is simply false. During the Zelensky inauguration on May 20th, the US delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government We were impressed by President Zelensky’s desire to promote a stronger relationship with the United States. We admired his commitment to reform and we were excited about the possible-",14:16,Sondland
18,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Commitment to reform and we were excited about the possibility of Ukraine making the changes necessary to support a greater western economic investment. And, we were excited that Ukraine might, after years and years of lip service, finally get serious about addressing its own well-known corruption problems. With that enthusiasm, we returned the White House on May 23rd to brief President Trump. We advised the president of the strategic importance of Ukraine and the value of strengthening the relationship with President Zelensky. To support this reformer, we asked the White House for two things. First, a working phone call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, and second, a working oval office visit. In our view, both were vital to cementing the US-Ukraine relationship, demonstrating support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression and advancing broader US foreign policy interests.",15:03,Sondland
19,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical. He expressed concerns that the Ukrainian government was not serious about reform and he even mentioned that Ukraine tried to take him down in the last election. In response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to, “talk with Rudy.” We understood that talk with Rudy meant, talk with Mr. Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer. Let me say again, we weren’t happy with the president’s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani. I believe then, as I do now, that the men and women of the state department, not the president’s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for Ukraine matters.",16:13,Sondland
20,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Nonetheless, based on the president’s direction we were faced with a choice, we could abandon the efforts to schedule the White House phone call and a White House visit between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, which was unquestionably in our foreign policy interest, or we could do as President Trump had directed and talk with Rudy. We chose the latter course, not because we liked it, but because it was the only constructive path open to us.",17:09,Sondland
21,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Over the course of the next several months, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I were in communication with Mr. Giuliani. Secretary Perry volunteered to make the initial calls with Mr. Giuliani given their prior relationship. Ambassador Volker made several of the early calls and generally informed us of what was discussed.",17:44,Sondland
22,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"I first communicated with Mr. Giuliani in early August, several months later. Mr. Giuliani emphasized that the president wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into the corruption issues. Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election, including the DNC server and Burisma, as two topics of importance to the president.",18:11,Sondland
23,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"We kept the leadership of the state department and the NSC, informed of our activities. And that included communications with Secretary of State Pompeo, his counselor, Ulrich Brechbuhl, his executive secretary, Lisa Kenna, and also communications with Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, Mr. Morrison, and their staff at the NSC. They knew what we were doing and why.",18:42,Sondland
24,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"On July 10th, 2019 Senior Ukrainian national security officials met with Ambassador Bolton, Ambassador Volker, Dr. Hill, Secretary Perry, myself, and several others in Washington DC. During that meeting, we all discussed the importance of the two action items I identified earlier. One, a working phone call, and two, a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky. From my perspective, the July 10th meeting was a positive step toward accomplishing our shared goals. While I am now aware of accounts of the meeting from Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Veneman, their recollections of those events simply don’t square with my own or with those of Ambassador Volker or Secretary Perry.",19:15,Sondland
25,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"I recall mentioning the prerequisite of investigations before any White House call or meeting, but I do not recall any yelling or screaming or abrupt terminations as others have said. Instead, after the meeting, Ambassador Bolton walked outside with our group and we all took some great pictures together outside on the White House lawn. More important, those recollections of protests do not square with the documentary record of our interactions with the NSC in the days and weeks that followed. We kept the NSC apprised of our efforts, including, specifically, our efforts to a public statement from the Ukrainians that would satisfy President Trump’s concerns.",20:12,Sondland
26,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"For example, on July 13th, and this is three days after that July 10th meeting, I emailed Tim Morrison. He had just taken over Dr. Hill’s post as the NSC Eurasia Director and I met him that day for the first time. I wrote to Mr. Morrison with these words, “The call between Zelensky and POTUS, President of the United States, should happen before 7/21, which is the parliamentary elections in Ukraine. Sole purpose is for Zelensky to give POTUS assurances of new sheriff in town, corruption ending, un-bundling moving forward,” and I emphasize, “any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently. Goal is for POTUS to invite him to oval. Volker, Perry, Bolton, and I strongly recommend.” Mr. Morrison acknowledged and said, “Thank you,” and specifically noted that he was tracking these issues.",21:04,Sondland
27,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Again, there was no secret regarding moving forward and the discussion of investigations. Moreover, I have reviewed other state department documents, some of which are not currently in the public domain, detailing Mr. Giuliani’s efforts. For example, on July 10th, the very same day that Ambassador Volker, Secretary Perry, and I were meeting with the Ukraine officials in Washington, Ambassador Taylor received a communication that Mr. Giuliani was still talking with Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenkoin. In WhatsApp messages with Ambassador Volker and I, Ambassador Taylor wrote to us as follows, “Just had a meeting with Andre and Vadim,” referring to Ukraine Foreign Minister Vadim Prystaiko. “Taylor said the Ukrainians were, “Very concerned about what Lutsenkoin told them,” that according to RG,” meaning Rudy Giuliani, “the Zelensky POTUS meeting will not happen.” Volcker responded, “Good grief. Please tell the deem to let the official US government representatives speak for the US. Lutsenkoin has his own self interest here.”",22:17,Sondland
28,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Taylor confirmed that he had communicated that message to the Ukrainians and he added, “I briefed Ulrich this afternoon on this,” referring to State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl. Again, everyone’s in the loop. Three things are critical about this WhatsApp exchange. First, while the Ukrainians were in Washington at the White House, Mr. Giuliani was communicating with the Ukrainians without our knowledge. Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and I were all surprised by this. Second, Mr. Giuliani was communicating with the, reportedly, corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor, Lutsenkoin and discussing whether a Zelensky-Trump meeting was going to happen again, without our knowledge. And third, with this alarming news, Ambassador Taylor briefed Ulrich Brechbuhl, who is the counselor to Secretary of State Pompeo. And even as late as September 24th of this year, Secretary Pompeo was directing Kurt Volker to speak with Mr. Giuliani. In a WhatsApp message, Kurt Volker told me in part, “Spoke with Rudy per guidance from S.” S is the state department’s official designator for the secretary. “Spoke with Rudy per guidance from S.”",23:44,Sondland
29,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Look, we tried our best to fix the problem while keeping the state department and the NSC closely apprised of the challenges we faced. On July 25th Presidents Trump and Zelensky had their official call. I was not on the call and I don’t think I was invited to be on the call. In fact, I first read the transcript on September 25th, the day it was publicly released. All I had heard at that time, was that the call had gone well. Looking back, I find it very odd, very odd, that neither I nor Ambassador Taylor, nor Ambassador Volker, ever received a detailed readout of that call with the Biden references.",25:11,Sondland
30,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Now, there are people who say they had concerns about the call, but no one shared any concerns about the call with me at the time, which frankly would have been very helpful to know. On July 26th Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and I were all in Kyiv to meet with President Zelensky. The timing of that trip, immediately after the call between Presidents Trump in Zelensky, was entirely, entirely coincidental. The key of meetings had been scheduled well before the date that the White House finally fixed the call. During our Kyiv meeting, I do not recall President Zelensky discussing the substance of his July 25th call with President Trump, nor did he discuss any request investigate Vice President Biden, which we all later learned was discussed on the July 25th call. And this is consistent with the reported comments from Ambassadors Volker and Taylor.",26:03,Sondland
31,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"After the Zelensky meeting, I also met with the Zelensky’s senior aide, Andriy Yermak. I don’t recall the specifics of our conversation, but I believe the issue was probably a part of that agenda or meeting. Also on July 26, shortly after our Kyiv meetings, I spoke by phone with President Trump. The White House, which has finally, finally shared certain call dates and times with my attorneys, confirms this. The call lasted five minutes. I remember I was at a restaurant in Kyiv and I have no reason to doubt that this conversation included the subject of investigations. Again, given Mr. Giuliani’s demand that President Zelensky make a public statement about investigations, I knew that investigations were important to President Trump. We did not discuss any classified information.",27:07,Sondland
32,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Other witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call. For the most part, I have no reason to doubt their accounts. It’s true that the president speaks loudly at times and it’s also true, I think we primarily discussed ASAP Rocky. It’s true that the president likes to use colorful language. Anyone who has met with him at any reasonable amount of time, knows this. Well I cannot remember the precise details, again, the White House has not allowed me to see any readouts of that call and the July 26th call did not strike me as significant at the time. Actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president’s concerns. However, I have no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son on that call or after the call ended.",28:05,Sondland
33,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question. Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes. Mr. Giuliani conveyed to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and others that President Trump wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing to investigations of Burisma and the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani expressed those requests directly to the Ukrainians and Mr. Giuliani also expressed those requests directly to us. We all understood that these prerequisites for the White House call and the White House meeting reflected President Trump’s desires and requirements.",29:07,Sondland
34,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Reflected President Trump’s desires and requirements. Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19th email. This email was sent. This email was sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack, who is Secretary Perry’s chief of staff at the time. Ms. Kenna, who is the acting… Pardon me. Who is the executive secretariat for Secretary Pompeo, Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Mr. Mulvaney’s senior advisor, Rob Blair. A lot of senior officials. A lot of senior officials.",30:02,Sondland
35,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Here is my exact quote from that email, “I talked to Zelensky just now. He is prepared to receive POTUS’s call. Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation, and will turn over every stone. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so that he can put out some media about a friendly and productive call. No details. Prior to Ukraine election on Sunday.” Chief of Staff Mulvaney responded, “I asked the NSC to set it up for tomorrow.” Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19th, days before the presidential call. As I communicated to the team, I told President Zelensky in advance that assurances to run a fully transparent investigation and turn over every stone were necessary in his call with President Trump. On July 19th, in a WhatsApp message between Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and me, Ambassador Volker stated, “Had breakfast with Rudy this morning.” That’s Ambassador Volker and Rudy Giuliani. “Teeing up call with Yermak Monday.” That’s senior advisor, Andriy Yermak. “Must have helped. Most important is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation and address any specific personnel issues, if there are any.”",30:45,Sondland
36,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"On August 10th, the next day, Mr. Yermak texted me, “Once we have a date,” which is a date for the White House meeting, “we will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of the US-Ukraine relationship, including among other things, Burisma and election meddling in investigations.” This is from Mr. Yermak to me.",32:33,Sondland
37,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"The following day, August 11th, and this is critical, I sent an email to Counselor Brechbuhl and Lisa Kenna. Lisa Kenna was frequently used as the pathway to Secretary Pompeo, as sometimes he preferred to receive his emails through her. She would print them out and put them in front of him. With the subject “Ukraine.” I wrote, “Mike,” referring to Mike Pompeo, “Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Zelensky to be delivered for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough,” the boss being the President, “to authorize an invitation. Zelensky plans to have a big presser,” press conference, ” on the openness subject, including specifics next week.” All of which referred to the 2016 and the Burisma.",33:06,Sondland
38,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Ms. Kenna replied, “Gordon, I’ll pass to the Secretary. Thank you.” Again, everyone was in the loop.",34:11,Sondland
39,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Curiously, and this was very interesting to me. On August 26th, shortly before his visit to Kiev, Ambassador Bolton’s office requested Mr. Giuliani’s contact information from me. I send Ambassador Bolton the information directly. They requested Mr. Giuliani’s contact information on August 26th. I was first informed that the White House was withholding security aid to Ukraine during conversations with Ambassador Taylor on July 18th, 2019. However, as I testified before, I was never able to obtain a clear answer regarding the specific reason for the hold, whether it was bureaucratic in nature, which often happens, or reflected some other concern in the interagency process. I never participated in any of the subsequent DOD or DOS review meetings that others have described, so I can’t speak to what was discussed in those meetings.",34:23,Sondland
40,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Nonetheless, before the September 1st Warsaw meeting, the Ukrainians had become aware that security funds had yet to be disbursed. In the absence of credible explanation for the hold, I came to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized.",35:43,Sondland
41,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"In preparation for the September 1 Warsaw meeting, I asked Secretary Pompeo whether a face-to-face conversation between Trump and Zelensky would help to break the logjam, and this was when President Trump was still intending to travel to Warsaw. Specifically, on August 22nd, I emailed Secretary Pompeo directly, copying Secretariat Kenna. I wrote, and this is my email to Secretary Pompeo, “Should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull-aside for POTUS to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place in mid-September, that Zelensky, he, Zelensky, should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to POTUS and the US. Hopefully, that will help break the logjam.” The Secretary replied, “Yes.”",36:06,Sondland
42,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"I followed up the next day asking to get 10 to 15 minutes on the Warsaw schedule for this. I said, “We’d like to know when it’s locked so that I can tell Zelensky and brief him.” Executive Secretary Kenna replied, “I will try for sure.”",37:19,Sondland
43,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Moreover, given my concerns about the security aid, I have no reason to dispute that portion of Senator Johnson’s recent letter, in which he recalls conversations he and I had on August 30th. By the end of August, my belief was that if Ukraine did something to demonstrate a serious intention to fight corruption, and specifically addressing Burisma and the 2016, then the hold on military aid would be lifted.",37:37,Sondland
44,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"There was a September 1st meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. Unfortunately, President Trump’s attendance at the Warsaw meeting was canceled due to Hurricane Dorian. Vice President Pence attended instead. I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations. I recall mentioning that before the Zelensky meeting.",38:08,Sondland
45,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. The Vice President said that he would speak to President Trump about it.",38:37,Sondland
46,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Based on my previous communication with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. Yermak. It was a very, very brief pull-aside conversation that happened within a few seconds. I told Mr. Yermak that I believed that the resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.",38:49,Sondland
47,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"As my other State Department colleagues have testified, this security aid was critical to Ukraine’s defense and should not have been delayed. I expressed this view to many during this period. But my goal, at the time, was to do what was necessary to get the aid released, to break the logjam. I believed that the public statement we had been discussing for weeks was essential to advancing that goal. I really regret that the Ukrainians were placed in that predicament, but I do not regret doing what I could to try to break the logjam and to solve the problem.",39:17,Sondland
48,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"I mentioned at the outset that throughout these events, we kept State Department leadership and others apprised of what we were doing. State Department was fully supportive of our engagement in Ukraine efforts, and was aware that a commitment to investigations was among the issues we were pursuing.",39:58,Sondland
49,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"To provide just two examples, on June 5th, the day after the US EU mission hosted our Independence Day, we did it a month early, Acting Assistant Secretary Phil Reeker sent an email to me, to Secretary Perry, and to others, forwarding some positive media coverage of President Zelensky’s attendance at our event. Mr. Reeker wrote, and I quote, “This headline underscores the importance and timeliness of Zelensky’s visit to Brussels, and the critical, perhaps historic, role of the dinner and engagement Gordon coordinated. Thank you for your participation and dedication to this effort.”",40:18,Sondland
50,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Months later, on September 3rd, I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote, “Mike, thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising. Really appreciate it.”",41:04,Sondland
51,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Secretary Pompeo replied the next day on Wednesday, September 4th, quote, “All good. You’re doing great work. Keep banging away.” State Department leadership expressed total support for our efforts to engage the new Ukrainian administration.",41:31,Sondland
52,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,"Look, I’ve never doubted the strategic value of strengthening our alliance with Ukraine. At all times, our efforts were in good faith and fully transparent to those tasked with overseeing them. Our efforts were reported and approved. Not once do I recall encountering an objection.",41:51,Sondland
53,Section_1,Gordon Sondland,It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their United States Ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the Committee’s questions. Thank you.,42:14,Sondland
54,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"your interest in being here. In turn, we ask for your respect as we proceed with today’s hearing. It is the intention of the committee to proceed without disruptions. As Chairman, I’ll make all necessary and appropriate steps to maintain order and to ensure the committee is run in accordance with house rules, and House Resolution 660. With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.",00:00,Sondland
55,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"This morning we will hear from Gordon Sondland, the American Ambassador to the European Union. We are here today as part of the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry, because president Donald Trump sought to condition military aid to Ukraine in an Oval Office meeting with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in exchange for politically motivated investigations that Trump believed would help his reelection campaign.",00:26,Sondland
56,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"The first investigation was of a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for interfering in the 2016 election. Second investigation that Trump demanded was into a political rival that he apparently feared most, Joe Biden. Trump sought to weaken Biden, and to refute the fact that his own election campaign in 2016 had been helped by Russian hacking and dumping operation, and Russian social media campaign directed by Vladimir Putin to help Trump.",00:51,Sondland
57,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Trump’s scheme undermined military and diplomatic support for a key ally, and undercut US anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. Trump put his personal and political interests above those of the United States. As ambassador Sondland would later tell career foreign service officer David Holmes, immediately after speaking to the President, “Trump did not give a expletive about Ukraine. He cares about big stuff that benefits him, like the Biden investigations that Rudy Giuliani was pushing.”",01:27,Sondland
58,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador Sondland was a skilled deal maker, but in trying to satisfy a directive from the President found himself increasingly embroiled in an effort to press the new Ukrainian president, that deviated sharply from the norm in both terms of policy and process. In February, Ambassador Sondland traveled to Ukraine on his first official trip to that country. While in Kiev, he met with then US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and found her to be an excellent diplomat with a deep command of Ukrainian internal dynamics.",01:58,Sondland
59,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"On April 21st, Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine and spoke to President Trump who congratulated him, and said he would look into attending Zelensky’s inauguration, but pledged to send someone at a very, very high level. Between the time of that call and the inaugural and May 20, Trump’s attitude towards Ukraine hardened.",02:29,Sondland
60,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"On May 13th, the President ordered Vice President Mike Pence, not to attend Zelensky’s inauguration, opting instead to dispatch the self dubbed Three Amigos; Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Ambassador Sondland, and Ambassador Kurt Volker, the special representative for Ukraine negotiations.",02:52,Sondland
61,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"After returning from the inauguration, members of the US delegation briefed President Trump on their encouraging first interactions with the new current Ukrainian administration. They urged the President to meet was Zelensky, but the President’s reaction was decidedly hostile. The President’s order was clear, however. Talk with Rudy.",03:09,Sondland
62,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"During this meeting, ambassador Sondland first became aware of what Giuliani and the President were really interested in. “This whole thing was sort of a continuum,” he testified at his deposition, “… starting at the May 23rd meeting. Ending up at the end of the line when the transcript of the call came out.” “It was a continuum,” he would explain, “… that became more insidious over time.”",03:31,Sondland
63,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"The Three Amigos were disappointed with Trump’s directive to engage Giuliani, but vowed to press ahead. Ambassador Sondland, “We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky,” which the group teamed crucial for US/Ukrainian relations, “… or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President’s concerns. We chose the latter path.”",03:58,Sondland
64,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"In the coming weeks, Ambassador Sondland got more clearly involved in Ukraine policymaking. Starting with the June 4 US mission to the EU Independence Day event in Brussels, one month early. Secretary Perry, Ulrich Brechbuhl and the State Department Counselor, and Sondland met with President Zelensky, whom Sondland had invited personally on the margins of the event.",04:24,Sondland
65,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"On June 10, 2019, Secretary Perry organized a conference call with Sondland, then National Security Advisor, John Bolton, Volker and others. They reviewed Ukraine strategy with Bolton and decided that Perry, Sondland and Volker would assist Ambassador Bill Taylor, the new acting ambassador in Kiev on Ukraine, and discuss Trump’s desire for Rudy Giuliani to be somehow involved. At the end of the call, according to Sondland, we all felt very comfortable with the strategy moving forward.",04:48,Sondland
66,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Two weeks later, on June 27th, Ambassador Sondland called Taylor to say that, “Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that he was not standing in the way of investigations.” On July 10th, Ambassador Sondland and other US officials met at the White House with a group of US and Ukrainian officials. Participants in the meeting have told us that Ambassador Sondland invoked acting White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and said that the White House meeting sought by the Ukrainian President with Trump would happen only if Ukraine undertook certain investigations. National Security Advisor, Bolton, abruptly ended the meeting upon hearing this.",05:17,Sondland
67,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Undeterred, Sondland brought Ukrainian delegation downstairs to another part of the White House and was more explicit. According to witnesses, Ukraine needed to investigate the Bidens or Burisma in the 2016 election interference if they wanted to get a meeting at all.",05:55,Sondland
68,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Following this meeting in July, Bolton said that he would not be part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this. Sondland continued to press for a meeting, but he and others were willing to settle for a phone call as an intermediate step.",06:11,Sondland
69,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"On July 21, Taylor texted Sondland that, “President Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument of Washington domestic reelection politics.” Sondland responded, “Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built irrespective of the pretext, so that Zelensky and Trump could meet and all of this will be fixed.”",06:25,Sondland
70,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"On July 25th, the day of the Trump/Zelensky call, Volker had lunch in Kiev with a senior aid to Ukrainian President Zelensky, and later texted the aide to say that he’d heard from the White House, “Assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck.”",06:54,Sondland
71,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Ambassador Sondland spoke to President Trump a few minutes before the call was placed, but was not on the call. During that now infamous phone call with Zelensky, Trump responded to the Ukrainian expression of appreciation for US defense support, and requests to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles by saying, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.” Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the discredited 2016 conspiracy theory, and even more ominously, look into the Bidens.",07:17,Sondland
72,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Neither had been part of the official preparatory material for the call, but they were in Donald Trump’s personal interest, and the interests of his reelection campaign. The Ukrainian President knew about both in advance. In part because of Ambassador Volker, and Ambassador Sondland’s efforts to make him aware of what the President was demanding.",07:46,Sondland
73,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Around this time, Ambassador Sondland became aware of the suspension of security assistance to Ukraine, which had been announced on a secure inter-agency video conference on July 18th. Telling us that it was extremely odd that nobody involved in making and implementing policy towards Ukraine knew why the aid had been put on hold. During August, Sondland participated in conference calls, and text messages with Volker and Juliani and said that the gist of every call was what was going to go in the press statement.",08:06,Sondland
74,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"In August, nine text message with Volker/Sondland stated, “I think POTUS really wants the deliverable,” which was according to Sondland a deliverable public statement that President Trump wanted to see or hear before a White House meeting could happen.",08:37,Sondland
75,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"On September 1, Ambassador Sondland participated in Vice President Pence’s bilateral meeting was Zelensky in Warsaw, during which Zelensky raised the suspended security assistance. Following that meeting, Sondland approached the senior Ukrainian official to tell him that he believed what could help them move the aid was if the Ukrainian Prosecutor General would go to the mic and announced that he was opening the Burisma investigation.",08:52,Sondland
76,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Sondland told Taylor that he had made a mistake by telling Ukrainians that an Oval Office Meeting was dependent on a public announcement of investigations. In fact, everything was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance.",09:18,Sondland
77,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Even the announcement by the Prosecutor General would not satisfy the President. On September 7, Sondland spoke to the President and told Tim Morrison and Bill Taylor about the call shortly thereafter. The President said that although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public we would be at a stalemate. Moreover, an announcement by the Prosecutor General would not be enough. President Zelensky must announce personally that he would open the investigations.",09:37,Sondland
78,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Sondland Taylor that, “President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something,” he said,”… the businessmen asks that person to pay up before signing the check.” The check referred to here was the US military assistance to Ukraine, and Ukraine had to pay up with investigations. Throughout early September, Volker and Sondland sought to close the deal on an agreement that Zelensky would announce investigations. After, Taylor texted Sondland on September 9, 2019 that, “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.”",10:07,Sondland
79,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"16 days later, the transcript of the July 25th call was made public, and the American people learn the truth of how our President tried to take advantage of a vulnerable ally. Now it is up to Congress, as the People’s representatives, to determine what response is appropriate. If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections. If he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign, and did so by withholding official act; a White House meeting, or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid, it will be up to us to decide whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency.",10:46,Sondland
80,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Finally, I want to say a word about the President and Secretary Pompeo’s obstruction of this investigation. We have not received a single document from the State Department. As Ambassador Sondland’s opening statement today will make clear, those documents bear directly on this investigation and this impeachment inquiry. I think we know now, based on a sample of the documents attached to Ambassador Sondland’s statement, that the knowledge of this scheme was far and wide, and included among others Secretary of State Pompeo, as well as the Vice President.",11:28,Sondland
81,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"We can see why Secretary Pompeo, and President Trump have made such a concerted, and across-the-board effort to obstruct this investigation and this impeachment inquiry. I will just say this. They do so at their own peril. I remind the President that Article Three of the Impeachment Articles drafted against President Nixon was his refusal to obey the subpoenas of Congress. With that, I recognize ranking member Nunes for any remarks that he would wish to make.",12:12,Sondland
82,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Thank the gentleman. As we learned last night, story time last night, we get story time first thing this morning. Ambassador Sondland, welcome. Glad you’re here. I’m really not glad you’re here, but welcome to the fifth day of this circus.",12:49,Sondland
83,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"As I’ve noted before, the Democrats on this committee spent three years accusing President Trump of being a Russian agent. In March 2018, after a year-long investigation, Intelligence Committee Republicans issued a 240-page report describing in detail how the Russians meddled in the 2016 elections, and making specific recommendations to improve our election security. Denouncing the report as a whitewash, and accusing Republicans of subverting the investigation, the Democrats issued their own report, focusing on their now debunked conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to hack the elections.",13:07,Sondland
84,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Notably, the Democrats vowed at the time to present a further “comprehensive report,” after they finished their investigation into Trump’s treasonous collusion with Russia. For some completely unexplainable reason, after the implosion of their Russia hoax, the Democrats failed to issue that comprehensive report. We’re still waiting.",13:54,Sondland
85,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"This episode shows how the Democrats have exploited the Intelligence Committee for political purposes for three years. Culminating in these impeachment hearings, and their mania to attack the President. No conspiracy theory is too outlandish for the Democrats. Time and time again, they floated the possibility of some farfetched malfeasance by Trump, declared the dire need to investigate it, and then suddenly dropped the issue and moved on to their next asinine theory.",14:20,Sondland
86,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"A sampling of their accusations and insinuations includes these. Trump is a long time Russian agent as described in the Steele dossier. The Russians gave Trump advanced access to emails stolen by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign. The Trump campaign based some of his activities on these stolen documents. Trump received nefarious materials from the Russians through a Trump campaign aid. Trump laundered Russian money through real estate deals. Trump was blackmailed by Russia through his financial exposure with Deutsche Bank. Trump had a diabolical plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Trump changed the Republican National Committee platform to hurt Ukraine, and benefit Russia. The Russians laundered money through the NRA for the Trump campaign. Trump’s son-in-law lied about his Russian contacts while obtaining his security clearance.",14:53,Sondland
87,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"It’s a long list of charges, all false, and I could go on, and on, and on but I’ll spare you for these moments. Clearly, these ludicrous accusations don’t reflect committee members who are honestly searching for the truth. They’re the actions of partisan extremists who hijacked the Intelligence Committee, transformed it into the Impeachment Committee, abandoned its core oversight functions, and turned it into a beachhead for ousting and elected president from office. You have to keep that history in mind as you consider the Democrats’ latest catalog of supposed Trump outrages.",15:58,Sondland
88,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Granted, a friendly call with the Ukrainian President wouldn’t seem to rise to the same level as being a Russian agent, but the Democrats were running out of time. If they waited any longer, their impeachment circus would intervene with their own candidates’ 2020 campaigns. You have to give them points for creativity, and selling this absurdity as an impeachable offense. All this explains why the Democrats have gathered zero Republican support in the House of Representatives for their impeachment crusade. In fact, the vote we held was a bipartisan vote against this impeachment inquiry.",16:39,Sondland
89,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Schiff, and Chairman Nadler are the key figures behind this impeachment crusade. All proclaim that impeachment is so damaging to the country that it can only proceed with bipartisan support. Are those declarations suddenly no longer true? Did impeachment become less divisive? Of course not. They know exactly what kind of damage they’re inflicting on this nation, that they’ve passed the point of no return.",17:21,Sondland
90,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"After three years of preparation work, much of it’s spearheaded by the Democrats on this committee, using all the tools of Congress to accuse, investigate, indict and smear the President. They stoked a frenzy amongst their most fanatical supporters that they can no longer control. Ambassador Sondland, you are here today to be smeared. You’ll make it through it, and I appreciate your service to this country, and I’m sorry that you’ve had to go through this.",17:54,Sondland
91,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"In closing, the Democrats have zeroed in on an anonymous whistleblower complaint that was cooked up in cooperation with the Democrats on this very committee. They lied to the American people about that cooperation, and refused to let us question the whistleblower to discover the truth. Meanwhile, the Democrats lash out against anyone who questions or casts doubt on this spectacle.",18:34,Sondland
92,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"When Ukrainian President Zelensky denies anything improper happened on the phone call, the Democrats say that he’s a liar. When journalists report on the Ukraine election meddling and Hunter Biden’s position on the board of corrupt Ukrainian companies, the Democrats label them conspiracy theorists. When the Democrats can’t get any traction for their allegations of quid pro quo, they move the goalpost and accuse the President of extortion. Then, bribery, and at last resort obstruction of justice.",19:05,Sondland
93,Section_2,Devin Nunes,The American people sent us to Washington to solve problems. Not to wage scorched earth political warfare against the other party. This impeachment is not helping the American people. It’s not a legitimate use of taxpayer dollars. It’s definitely not improving our national security.,19:42,Sondland
94,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Finally, the Democrats’ fake outrage that President Trump used his own channel to communicate with Ukraine. I’ll remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that our first president, George Washington, directed his own diplomatic channels to secure a treaty with great Britain. If my Democratic colleagues were around in 1794, they’d probably want to impeach him too.",20:03,Sondland
95,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"Mr. Chairman, this morning. We have transmitted to you a letter exercising our rights under H.Res.660 to subpoena documents and witnesses. We take this step because you have failed to ensure fairness and objectivity in this inquiry. As such, we need to subpoena Hunter Biden, and the whistleblower for closed-door depositions, as well as relevant documents from the DNC, Hunter Biden’s firm, Rosemont Seneca, and the whistle blower.",20:36,Sondland
96,Section_2,Devin Nunes,"In the interest of some basic level of fairness, we expect you to concur with these subpoenas. I’ll submit that letter for the record, and yield back the balance of my time.",21:08,Sondland
97,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"I thank the gentleman. We are joined this afternoon by Ambassador Gordon Sondland. I’m sorry, this morning. It was a long day yesterday. Gordon Sondland is the US Representative to the European Union with the rank of Ambassador. Before joining the State Department, Ambassador Sondland was the founder and CEO of Providence Hotels, a national owner and operator of full service hotels. Also prior to his government service, Ambassador Sondland was engaged in charitable enterprises.",21:23,Sondland
98,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"Two final points before witness is sworn. First, witness depositions as part of this inquiry were unclassified in nature, and all open hearings will also be held at the unclassified level. Any information that may touch on classified information will be addressed separately. Second, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal, threat of reprisal, or attempt to retaliate against any US government official for testifying before Congress, including you or any of your colleagues. If you would please rise and raise your right hand, I will begin by swearing you in.",21:55,Sondland
99,Section_2,Adam Schiff,"We will now proceed the first round of questions as detailed in the memo provided to committee members. There’ll be 45 minutes of questions conducted by the chairman and majority counsel followed by 45 minutes for the ranking member or minority counsel. Following that, unless I specify additional equal time for extended questioning, we will proceed under the five minute rule and every member will have the chance to ask questions. I recognize myself or majority counsel for the first round of questions. Ambassador Sondland, there’s a lot of new material in your opening statement for us to get through, but I want to start with a few top line questions before passing it over to Mr. Goldman. In your deposition, you testified that you found yourself on a continuum that became more insidious over time. Can you describe what you mean by this continuum of insidiousness?",00:00,Sondland
100,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, Mr. Chairman, when we left the Oval Office I believe on May 23rd, the request was very generic for an investigation of corruption in a very vanilla sense and dealing with some of the oligarch problems in Ukraine, which were longstanding problems. And then as time went on, more specific items got added to the menu, including the Burisma and 2016 election meddling specifically, the DNC server specifically. And over this, over this continuum, it became more and more difficult to secure the White House Meeting because more conditions were being placed on the White House meeting.",00:53,Sondland
101,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And then of course, on July 25th, although you were not privy to the call and other condition was added, that being the investigation of the Bidens.",01:44,Sondland
102,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I was not privy to the call and I did not know that the condition of investigating the Bidens was a condition, correct.",01:53,Sondland
103,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"You saw that in the call record, correct?",02:01,Sondland
104,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It was not in any record I received.,02:03,Sondland
105,Section_3,Adam Schiff,But when you did receive-,02:05,Sondland
106,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yes, I saw that in September, correct.",02:06,Sondland
107,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"So on this continuum, the beginning of the continuum begins on May 23rd when the President instructs you to talk to Rudy?",02:10,Sondland
108,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,02:17,Sondland
109,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And you understood that as a direction by the President that you needed to satisfy the concerns that Rudy Giuliani would express to you about what the President wanted in Ukraine?,02:18,Sondland
110,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Not to me, to the entire group, Volker, Perry and myself, correct.",02:28,Sondland
111,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now in your opening statement, you confirm that there was a quid pro quo between the White House meeting and the investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election that Giuliani was publicly promoting, is that right?",02:33,Sondland
112,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,02:44,Sondland
113,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And in fact, you say that other senior officials in the State Department and the chief of staff’s office, including Mick Mulvaney, Secretary Pompeo, were aware of this quid pro quo, that in order to get the White House Meeting that we’re going to have to be these investigations the President wanted.",02:49,Sondland
114,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,03:07,Sondland
115,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And those again, are investigations into 2016 and Burisma slash the Bidens?",03:09,Sondland
116,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"2016, Burisma. The Biden’s did not come up.",03:14,Sondland
117,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"But you would ultimately learn that Burisma meant the Bidens when you saw the call record, correct?",03:19,Sondland
118,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Of course, today I know exactly what it means. I didn’t know at the time.",03:24,Sondland
119,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And then on July 26th you confirm you did indeed have the conversation with president Trump from a restaurant in Kiev that David Holmes testified about last week, is that right?",03:33,Sondland
120,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,03:41,Sondland
121,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And you have no reason to doubt Mr. Holmes recounting of your conversation with the President?,03:43,Sondland
122,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"The only part of Mr. Holmes recounting that I take exception with is I do not recall mentioning the Bidens, that did not enter my mind. It was Burisma and 2016 elections.",03:49,Sondland
123,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"You have no reason to believe that Mr. Holmes would make that up if that’s what he recalls you saying? You have no reason to question that, do you?",04:00,Sondland
124,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall saying Biden. I never recalled saying Biden.,04:06,Sondland
125,Section_3,Adam Schiff,But the rest of Mr. Holmes recollection is consistent with your own?,04:14,Sondland
126,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I can’t testify as to what Mr. Holmes might or might not have heard through the phone. I don’t know how he heard the conversation.",04:19,Sondland
127,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Are you familiar with his testimony?,04:26,Sondland
128,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Vaguely, yes.",04:28,Sondland
129,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And the only exception you take as to the mention of the name Biden?,04:30,Sondland
130,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,04:33,Sondland
131,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And I think you said in your testimony this morning that not only is it correct that the President brought up with you investigations on the phone the day after the July 25th call, but you would have been surprised had he not brought that up, is that right?",04:40,Sondland
132,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Right, because we had been hearing about it from Rudy and we presumed Rudy was getting it from the President, so it seemed like a logical conclusion.",04:55,Sondland
133,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Holmes also testified that you told him, “President Trump doesn’t care about Ukraine. He only cares about big stuff that relates to him personally.” I take it from your comment you don’t dispute that part of the conversation.",05:07,Sondland
134,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, he made that clear in the May 23rd meeting that he was not particularly fond of Ukraine and we had a lot of heavy lifting to do to get him to engage.",05:19,Sondland
135,Section_3,Adam Schiff,So you don’t dispute that part of Mr. Holmes’ recollection?,05:29,Sondland
136,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,05:32,Sondland
137,Section_3,Adam Schiff,In August when you worked with Rudy Giuliani and a top Ukrainian aid to draft a public statement for President Zelensky to issue that includes the announcement investigations into Burisma. You understood that was required by President Trump before he would grant the White House meeting to President Zelensky?,05:39,Sondland
138,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,05:54,Sondland
139,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And the Ukrainians understood that as well?,05:56,Sondland
140,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I believe they did.,05:58,Sondland
141,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And you informed Secretary Pompeo about that statement as well?,05:59,Sondland
142,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I did.,06:03,Sondland
143,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Later in August, you told Secretary Pompeo that President Zelensky would be prepared to tell President Trump that his new justice officials would be able to announce matters of interest to the President, which could break the log jam. When you say matters of interest to the President, you mean the investigations that President Trump wanted, is that right?",06:08,Sondland
144,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,06:27,Sondland
145,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And that involved 2016 and Burisma or the Bidens?,06:28,Sondland
146,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,2016 and Burisma.,06:33,Sondland
147,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And when you’re talking here about breaking the logjam, you’re talking about the logjam over the security assistance, correct?",06:36,Sondland
148,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I was talking logjam generically because nothing was moving.,06:42,Sondland
149,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"But that included the security assistance, did it not?",06:46,Sondland
150,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,06:48,Sondland
151,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And based on the context of that email, this was not the first time you had discussed his investigations with Secretary Pompeo was it?",06:52,Sondland
152,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,06:59,Sondland
153,Section_3,Adam Schiff,He was aware of the connections that you were making between the investigations and the White House meeting and security assistance?,07:02,Sondland
154,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,07:08,Sondland
155,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Did he ever take issue with you and say, “No, that connection is not there or you’re wrong?”",07:12,Sondland
156,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Not that I recall.,07:17,Sondland
157,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now you mentioned that you also had a conversation with Vice President Pence before his meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw and that you raised the concern you had as well, that the security assistance was being withheld because of the President’s desire to get a commitment from Zelensky to pursue these political investigations. What did you say to the Vice President?",07:23,Sondland
158,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I was in a briefing with several people and I just spoke up and I said, “It appears that everything is stalled until this statement gets made.” Something, words to that effect, and that’s what I believe to be the case based on the work that the three of us had been doing, Volcker, Perry and myself and the Vice President nodded like he heard what I said and that was pretty much it, as I recall.",07:43,Sondland
159,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And you understood that the Ukrainians were going to raise the security assistance with the Vice President at this meeting?,08:13,Sondland
160,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I didn’t know what they were going to raise, but they in fact did raise it, Mr. Chairman.",08:20,Sondland
161,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Well, it was public by that point that there was a hold on the security assistance, correct?",08:25,Sondland
162,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, but I didn’t know what they were going to raise. I didn’t get a pre-brief from the Ukrainians.",08:28,Sondland
163,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Well, you knew certainly they were concerned about the hold on the security assistance, right?",08:33,Sondland
164,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"They were concerned, obviously.",08:37,Sondland
165,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And you wanted to help prepare the Vice President for the meeting by letting him know what you thought was responsible for the hold on the security assistance.,08:39,Sondland
166,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s fair.,08:46,Sondland
167,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Do you recall anything else the Vice President said other than nodding his head when you made him aware of this fact?,08:48,Sondland
168,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, I don’t have a readout of that meeting, so I can’t remember anything else.",08:53,Sondland
169,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And it was immediately after this meeting between the Vice President and Zelensky that you went to speak with Yermak and you told him similarly that in order to release the military assistance they were going to have to publicly announce these investigations?,08:59,Sondland
170,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, much has been made of that meeting and it really wasn’t a meeting. What happened was everyone got up after the bilateral meeting between President Zelensky and Vice President Pence and people do what they normally do. They get up, they mill around, they shake hands. And I don’t know if I came over to Yermak or he came over to me, but he said, “What’s going on here?” And I said, “I don’t know. It might all be tied together now, I have no idea.” I was presuming that it was, but it was a very short conversation.",09:13,Sondland
171,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Well, in that short conversation, as you would later relay to Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor, you informed Mr. Yermak that they would need to announce these investigations in order to get the aid, did you not?",09:41,Sondland
172,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, Mr. Yermak was already working on those investigation or on the statement about the investigations.",09:53,Sondland
173,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And you confirmed for him that he needed to get it done if they were going to get the military aid.,10:01,Sondland
174,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I likely did.,10:04,Sondland
175,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor have also relayed a conversation you had with the President following the Warsaw meeting, in which the President relayed to you that there was no quid pro quo but nevertheless, unless Zelensky went to the mic and announced these investigations, they would be a stalemate over the aide, is that correct?",10:11,Sondland
176,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,10:33,Sondland
177,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And that was an accurate reflection of your discussion with the President?,10:34,Sondland
178,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, that email was not artfully written. I’m the first to admit what I was trying to convey to Ambassador Taylor after his frantic emails to me and to others about the security assistance, which by the way, I agreed with him. I thought it was a very bad idea to hold that money. I finally called the President, I believe it was on the 9th of September. I can’t find the records and they won’t provide them to me. But I believe I just asked him an open ended question. Mr. Chairman, “What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories and this and that. What do you want?” And it was a very short, abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood and he just said, “I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.” Something to that effect.",10:37,Sondland
179,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"So I typed out a text to Ambassador Taylor and my reason for telling him this was not to defend what the President was saying, not to opine on whether the President was being truthful or untruthful but simply to relay, “I’ve gone as far as I can go. This is the final word that I heard from the President of the United States. If you’re still concerned, you Ambassador Taylor are still concerned, please get ahold of the Secretary, maybe he can help.”",11:31,Sondland
180,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"I’m not asking you about your text message. I’m asking about your conversations with Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor after you spoke with the President, either in that call or in a different call.",12:01,Sondland
181,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I’m confused, Mr. Chairman, which conversations with Mr. Morrison and Mr. Taylor?",12:11,Sondland
182,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Well, Mr. Morrison testified that you relayed a conversation you had with the President, in which the president told you no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky must go to a microphone and announce these investigations and that he should want to. Similarly, you told Ambassador Taylor that while the President said no quid pro quo, unless Zelensky announced these investigations, they would be at a stalemate. Presumably a stalemate over the military assistance. Do you have any reason to question those conversations that Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor took notes about?",12:16,Sondland
183,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I think it’s tied to my text, Mr. Chairman, because in my text I think I said something to the effect that he wants Zelensky to do what he ran on I believe his transparency, et cetera, et cetera, which was my clumsy way of saying he wanted these announcements to be made.",12:56,Sondland
184,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Again, Ambassador, I’m not asking about your text message. I’m asking you about what you relayed to Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison about your conversation with the President. Do you have any reason to question their recollection of what you told them?",13:16,Sondland
185,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"All I can say is that I expressed what I told or what the President told me in that text. And if I had relayed anything other than what was in that text, I don’t recall.",13:30,Sondland
186,Section_3,Adam Schiff,You don’t recall?,13:44,Sondland
187,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall.,13:45,Sondland
188,Section_3,Adam Schiff,You have no reason to question Ambassador Taylor or Mr. Morrison of what they wrote in their notes about your conversation with them.,13:46,Sondland
189,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Could you kindly repeat what they wrote?,13:54,Sondland
190,Section_3,Adam Schiff,I’ll have Mr. Goldman go through that with you.,13:56,Sondland
191,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’d be great.,13:58,Sondland
192,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"But let me get to the the top line here, Ambassador Sondland.",13:59,Sondland
193,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Okay.,14:02,Sondland
194,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"You’ve testified that the White House meeting that President Zelensky desperately wanted and that was very important to President Zelensky, was it not?",14:05,Sondland
195,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Absolutely.,14:15,Sondland
196,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"You’ve testified that that meeting was conditioned was a quid pro quo for what the President wanted, these two investigations, isn’t that right?",14:17,Sondland
197,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,14:27,Sondland
198,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And that everybody knew it.,14:28,Sondland
199,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,14:29,Sondland
200,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now that White House meeting was going to be an official meeting between the two presidents, correct?",14:32,Sondland
201,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Presumably.,14:37,Sondland
202,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"It would be an Oval Office meeting, hopefully.",14:39,Sondland
203,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"A working meeting, yes.",14:41,Sondland
204,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"A working meeting, so an official act, correct?",14:42,Sondland
205,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yeah.,14:45,Sondland
206,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And in order to perform that official act, Donald Trump, wanted these two investigations that would help his re-election campaign, correct?",14:46,Sondland
207,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I can’t characterize why he wanted them, all I can tell you is this is what we heard from Mr. Giuliani.",14:55,Sondland
208,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"But he had to get those two investigations if that official act was going to take place, correct?",15:01,Sondland
209,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"He had to announce the investigations, he didn’t actually have to do them as I understood it.",15:08,Sondland
210,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Okay, President Zelensky had to announce the two investigations the President wanted, make a public announcement, correct?",15:13,Sondland
211,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,15:20,Sondland
212,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And those were of great value to the President, he was quite insistent upon them and his attorney was insistent upon them?",15:22,Sondland
213,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t want to characterize whether they are of value, not value. Again, through Mr. Giuliani, we were led to believe that that’s what he wanted.",15:28,Sondland
214,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Well, and you said that Mr. Giuliani was acting at the President’s demand, correct?",15:37,Sondland
215,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Right. When the President says, “Talk to my personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani,” we followed his direction.",15:42,Sondland
216,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And so that official act of that meeting was being conditioned on the performance of these things the president wanted as expressed both directly and through his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, correct?",15:47,Sondland
217,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"As expressed through Rudy Giuliani, correct.",15:59,Sondland
218,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And you’ve also testified that your understanding, it became your clear understanding that the military assistance was also being withheld pending Zelensky announcing these investigations, correct?",16:02,Sondland
219,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"That was my presumption, my personal presumption based on the facts at the time, nothing was moving.",16:14,Sondland
220,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And in fact, you had a discussion, communication with the Secretary of State, which you said that logjam over aid could be lifted if Zelensky announced these investigations, right?",16:22,Sondland
221,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I did not, I don’t recall saying the logjam over aid, I recall saying the logjam, I don’t know-",16:34,Sondland
222,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"That that’s what you meant, right Ambassador?",16:39,Sondland
223,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I meant that whatever was holding up the meeting, whatever was holding up our deal with Ukraine, I was trying to break. Again, I was presuming-",16:41,Sondland
224,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Well, here’s what you said in your testimony a moment ago.",16:55,Sondland
225,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Okay.,16:57,Sondland
226,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Page 18, “But my goal at the time was to do what was necessary to get the aid released to break the logjam.” Okay, that’s still your testimony, right?",16:58,Sondland
227,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yeah.,17:07,Sondland
228,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"So the military aid is also an official act, am I right?",17:09,Sondland
229,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,17:16,Sondland
230,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"This is not President Trump’s personal bank account he’s writing a check from, this is $400 million of U.S. taxpayer money, is it not?",17:17,Sondland
231,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Absolutely.,17:24,Sondland
232,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And there was a logjam, in which the President would not write that U.S. check you believed until Ukraine announced these two investigations the President wanted, correct?",17:25,Sondland
233,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That was my belief.,17:38,Sondland
234,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Goldman.,17:40,Sondland
235,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In your opening statement, Ambassador Sondland, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks, is that right?",17:42,Sondland
236,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,In terms of refreshing my recollection.,17:58,Sondland
237,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Right, because reviewing these documents has helped you to remember the events that we’re asking about. Is that correct?",18:00,Sondland
238,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,18:08,Sondland
239,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Because you acknowledge of course, that when you can place a document and a date and a context, it helps to jog your memory.",18:09,Sondland
240,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,18:15,Sondland
241,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And so you would agree that for people unlike yourself who take notes, that that is very helpful to their own recollection of events, right?",18:16,Sondland
242,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think you asked your question backwards. Are you saying people that take notes, it’s helpful to have those documents or people that don’t take notes, it’s helpful to have those documents?",18:29,Sondland
243,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"No, no. You are not a note taker, right?",18:37,Sondland
244,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I’m not a note taker, never have been.",18:40,Sondland
245,Section_3,Dan Goldman,But you would agree that people who do take contemporaneous notes generally are more able to remember things then people who don’t.,18:41,Sondland
246,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Some, yes.",18:51,Sondland
247,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And there are additional documents that you’ve been unable to obtain, is that right?",18:53,Sondland
248,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,18:57,Sondland
249,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And I think you even said in your opening statement that the State Department prevented you and your staff from trying to gather more documents. Is that correct?,18:58,Sondland
250,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Certain documents, yes.",19:07,Sondland
251,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Which documents?,19:09,Sondland
252,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Documents that I didn’t have immediate access to.,19:10,Sondland
253,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And who at the State Department prevented you from doing that?,19:13,Sondland
254,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"You have to ask my counsel, he was dealing with them.",19:16,Sondland
255,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"But certainly based on the additional memory that you have gained over the past few weeks from reading the testimony of others, based on their notes and reviewing your own documents, you have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed, is that right?",19:18,Sondland
256,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,19:37,Sondland
257,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26th in that restaurant in Kiev, right?",19:38,Sondland
258,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, what triggered my memory was someone’s reference to ASAP Rocky, which was I believe the primary purpose of the phone call.",19:48,Sondland
259,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Certainly, so that’s one way memory works isn’t it? And you were sitting in a restaurant with David Holmes in Kiev, right, having lunch?",19:55,Sondland
260,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think I took the whole team out to lunch after the meeting, yeah.",20:06,Sondland
261,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And it was a meeting, a one-on-one meeting you had with Andriy Yermak?",20:10,Sondland
262,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, trying to reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit. But if someone said I had a meeting and I went to the meeting, then I’m not going to dispute that.",20:16,Sondland
263,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And particularly if that person took notes at that meeting.,20:28,Sondland
264,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,20:31,Sondland
265,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Or sat outside the door when you didn’t let them in?,20:32,Sondland
266,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I have no control over who goes into a meeting in Ukraine, that was the Ukrainians that didn’t let them in.",20:35,Sondland
267,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you had also met with President Zelensky among others that day, is that right?",20:41,Sondland
268,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,20:44,Sondland
269,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you called President Trump from your cell phone from the restaurant, is that right?",20:46,Sondland
270,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,20:53,Sondland
271,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And this was not a secure line, was it?",20:54,Sondland
272,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, it was an open line.",20:56,Sondland
273,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Did you worry that a foreign government may be listening to your phone call with the President of the United States?,20:58,Sondland
274,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I have a unclassified conversations all the time from landlines that are unsecured and cell phones. If the topic is not classified and it’s up to the President to decide what’s classified and what’s not classified. And we were having … he was aware that it was an open line as well.",21:04,Sondland
275,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you don’t recall the specifics of holding your phone far away from your ear as Mr. Holmes testified, but you have no reason to question his recollection of that, do you?",21:23,Sondland
276,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I mean it seems a little strange I would hold my phone here. I probably had my phone close to my ear and he claims to have overheard part of the conversation and I’m not going to dispute what he did or didn’t hear.,21:38,Sondland
277,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Well, he also testified that you confirmed to President Trump that you were in Ukraine at the time and that President Zelensky quote loves your ass unquote. Do you recall saying that?",21:49,Sondland
278,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, it sounds like something I would say. That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four letter words. In this case, three letters.",22:03,Sondland
279,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Holmes then said that he heard President Trump ask “Is he,” meaning Zelensky, going to do the investigation?” To which you replied, “He’s going to do it.” And then you added that President Zelensky will do anything that you, meaning President Trump, asked him to. Do you recall that?",22:17,Sondland
280,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I probably said something to that effect because I remember the meeting, President Zelensky was very, solicitous is not a good word. He was just very willing to work with the United States and was being very amicable. And so putting it in Trump speak by saying “he loves your ass, he’ll do whatever you want,” meant that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.",22:38,Sondland
281,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"He was not only willing, he was very eager, right?",23:05,Sondland
282,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s fair.,23:09,Sondland
283,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Because Ukraine depends on the United States as its most significant ally, isn’t that correct?",23:10,Sondland
284,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"One of its most, absolutely.",23:15,Sondland
285,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Just so we understand, you were in Kiev the day after President Trump spoke to President Zelensky on the phone and you now know from reading the call record that in that phone call he requested a favor for President Zelensky to do investigations related to the Bidens and the 2016 election, right?",23:19,Sondland
286,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I do now know that, yes.",23:44,Sondland
287,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you met with President Zelensky and his aides on the day after that phone call and then you had a conversation with President Trump from your cell phone from a restaurant terrace, and he asked you whether President Zelensky will do the investigations. And you responded that he’s going to do them or it, and that President Zelensky will do anything you ask them to do. Is that an accurate recitation of what happened there?",23:46,Sondland
288,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It could have been words to that effect. I don’t remember my exact response.,24:13,Sondland
289,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"But you don’t have any reason to dispute Mr. Holmes’ recollection, correct?",24:18,Sondland
290,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I won’t dispute it, but again, I don’t recall.",24:22,Sondland
291,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"After you hung up with the President, Mr. Holmes testified about a conversation that you and he had, where he says that you told Mr. Holmes that the President does not care about Ukraine, but the President used the more colorful language including a four letter word that you just referenced to, you’ve just referenced. Do you recall saying that to Mr. Holmes?",24:26,Sondland
292,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I don’t recall my exact words, but clearly the President beginning on May 23rd when we met with him in the Oval Office was not a big fan.",24:52,Sondland
293,Section_3,Dan Goldman,But he was a big fan of the investigations?,25:03,Sondland
294,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Apparently so.,25:06,Sondland
295,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, Mr. Holmes said that you said that President Trump only cares about the “big stuff” that benefits himself. Is that something that you would have said at the time?",25:08,Sondland
296,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t think I would have said that. I would have honestly said that he was not a big fan of Ukraine and he wants the investigations that we had been talking about for quite some time to move forward. That’s what I would’ve said because that’s the fact.,25:21,Sondland
297,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Mr. Holmes also remembers that you told him in giving an example of the big stuff, the Biden investigation that Rudy Giuliani was pushing. Do you recall that?",25:36,Sondland
298,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t, I recall Burisma, not Biden.",25:50,Sondland
299,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"But do you recall saying, at least referring to an investigation that Rudy Giuliani was pushing, is that something that you likely would have said?",25:53,Sondland
300,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I would have, yes.",26:01,Sondland
301,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now, even if you don’t recall specifically mentioning the Biden investigation to David Holmes, we know that it was certainly on President Trump’s mind. Because just the day before in his call with President Zelensky, he mentions specifically the Biden investigation. And I want to show you that exhibit or that excerpt from the call on July 25th, where President Trump says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.”",26:05,Sondland
302,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"President Zelensky then responds without reference to the company that he’s referring to. And two witnesses yesterday said that when President Zelensky actually said the company, he said Burisma. So you would agree that regardless of whether you knew about the connection to the Bidens, at the very least, that you now know that that’s what President Trump wanted at the time through the Burisma investigation.",26:55,Sondland
303,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I now know it all, of course.",27:24,Sondland
304,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And at this time you were aware of the President’s desire along with Rudy Giuliani to do these investigations, including the 2016 election interference investigation, is that right?",27:26,Sondland
305,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,27:38,Sondland
306,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you said President Trump had directed you to talk, you and the others to talk to Rudy Giuliani at the Oval Office on May 23rd, is that right?",27:40,Sondland
307,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"If we wanted to get anything done with Ukraine, it was apparent to us we needed to talk to Rudy.",27:51,Sondland
308,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Right, you understood that Mr. Giuliani spoke for the President, correct?",27:55,Sondland
309,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,28:00,Sondland
310,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, President Trump also made that clear to President Zelensky in that same July 25th phone call, he said, “Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the Mayor of New York city, a great mayor and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy.” And after this, President Trump then mentions Mr. Giuliani twice more in that call. Now from Mr. Giuliani by this point, you understood that in order to get that White House meeting that you wanted President Zelensky to have and that President Zelensky desperately wanted to have, that Ukraine would have to initiate these two investigations. Is that right?",28:03,Sondland
311,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, they would have to announce that they were going to do it.",28:55,Sondland
312,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Right, because Giuliani and President Trump didn’t actually care if they did them, right?",28:58,Sondland
313,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I never heard, Mr. Goldman, anyone say that the investigations had to start or had to be completed. The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani or otherwise was that they had to be announced in some form and that form kept changing.",29:03,Sondland
314,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Announced publicly?,29:19,Sondland
315,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Announced publicly.,29:20,Sondland
316,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you of course, recognized that there would be political benefits to a public announcement as opposed to a private confirmation, right?",29:21,Sondland
317,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, the way it was expressed to me was that the Ukrainians had a long history of committing to things privately and then never following through. So President Trump presumably, again communicated through Mr. Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians on record publicly that they were going to do these investigations. That’s the reason that was given to me.",29:27,Sondland
318,Section_3,Dan Goldman,But you never heard anyone say that they really wanted them to do the investigations? Just that they want it to announce-,29:47,Sondland
319,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I didn’t hear either way.,29:55,Sondland
320,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now your July 26th call with the President was not the only time that you spoke to the President surrounding that Ukraine trip, was it?",29:59,Sondland
321,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I believe I spoke to him before his call.,30:08,Sondland
322,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So that would be on July 25th, the day before?",30:14,Sondland
323,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, I think I was flying to Ukraine and I spoke with him, if I recall correctly just before I got on the plane.",30:16,Sondland
324,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So that’s two private telephone calls with President Trump in the span of two days, is that right?",30:24,Sondland
325,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,30:29,Sondland
326,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"You had direct access then to President Trump, correct?",30:31,Sondland
327,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I had a occasional access when he chose to take my call. Sometimes he would, sometimes he wouldn’t.",30:34,Sondland
328,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Well he certainly took your call twice as it related to Ukraine on these two days, is that right?",30:40,Sondland
329,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He did.,30:44,Sondland
330,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now the morning of July 25th, you texted Ambassador Volker and we could bring up the next text exchange at 7:54 AM and you said, “Call ASAP.” Ambassador Volker did not respond to you for another hour and a half and he said, “Hi Gordon, got your message, had a great lunch with Yermak and then passed your message to him. He will see you tomorrow. Think everything in place.” Volker though, an hour before that and about a half an hour before the phone call, had texted Andriy Yermak, a top aid for President Zelensky and he wrote, “Good lunch, thanks. Heard from White House, assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck. See you tomorrow.”",30:47,Sondland
331,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Ambassador Sondland, was this message that Kurt Volker passed to Andryi Yermak the message you left for Kurt Volker on that voicemail that he referenced?",31:38,Sondland
332,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"You know, I don’t remember Mr. Goldman, but it very well could have been.",31:48,Sondland
333,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"You don’t have any reason to think it wasn’t, right?",31:52,Sondland
334,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I honestly, honestly don’t remember, but seems logical to me.",31:54,Sondland
335,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And if Ambassador Volker testified that he did get that message from you, you have no reason-",32:00,Sondland
336,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And if Ambassador Volker testified that he did get that message from you, you have no reason to doubt that.",32:03,Sondland
337,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, if he testified that he got that message from me, then I would concur with that.",32:05,Sondland
338,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So, is it fair to say that this message is what you received from President Trump in that phone call that morning?",32:09,Sondland
339,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, if he testified to that to refresh my own memory, then yes, it’s likely I would have received that from President Trump.",32:14,Sondland
340,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"But the sequence certainly makes sense, right?",32:21,Sondland
341,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, it does.",32:23,Sondland
342,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"You talked to President Trump, you told Kurt Volker call you, you left a message for Kurt Volker. Kurt Volker sent this text message to Andrei Yermak to prepare Presidents Zelensky, and then President Trump had a phone call where President Zelensky spoke very similar to what was in this text message. Right?",32:24,Sondland
343,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Right.,32:42,Sondland
344,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you would agree that the message in this, that is expressed here is that President Zelensky needs to convince Trump that he will do the investigations in order to nail down the date for a visit to Washington, DC. Is that correct?",32:43,Sondland
345,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,32:58,Sondland
346,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now, I’m going to move ahead in time to the end of August and early September when you came to believe, I believe as you testified, that it wasn’t just the White House meeting that was contingent on the announcement of these investigations that the president wanted, but security assistance as well. You testified that in the absence of any credible explanation for the hold on security assistance, you came to the conclusion that like the White House visit, the aid was conditioned on the investigations that President Trump wanted. Is that what you said in your opening statement?",33:04,Sondland
347,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It is.,33:39,Sondland
348,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So, let me break this down with you. By this time you, and many top officials, knew that that coveted White House meeting for President Zelensky was conditioned on these investigations, right?",33:41,Sondland
349,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"The announcement of the investigations, correct.",33:55,Sondland
350,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Thank you. And that includes Secretary Pompeo right?,33:56,Sondland
351,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Many, many people.",34:01,Sondland
352,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And well, Secretary Pompeo?",34:03,Sondland
353,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,34:04,Sondland
354,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And acting chief of staff Mulvaney.,34:05,Sondland
355,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,34:06,Sondland
356,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you testified that this was a quid pro quo, is that right?",34:08,Sondland
357,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I did.,34:11,Sondland
358,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you, at this point by the end of August, knew that the aide had been held up for at least six weeks. Is that correct?",34:12,Sondland
359,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I believe I found out through Ambassador Taylor that the aid had been held up around July 18th, is when I heard originally.",34:19,Sondland
360,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And even though you searched for reasons, you were never given a credible explanation, is that right?",34:28,Sondland
361,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,34:34,Sondland
362,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And no one you spoke to thought that the aid should be held to your knowledge, is that right?",34:35,Sondland
363,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I never heard anyone advocate for holding the aid.,34:41,Sondland
364,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And now, by this point, at the end of August it went public and the Ukrainians knew about it. Right?",34:45,Sondland
365,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I believe there was some press reports, you know, presuming or who knows, but I think at that point it became sort of common knowledge that everything might be tied together.",34:51,Sondland
366,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, President Zelensky brought it up at that September 1st meeting with Vice President Pence that you were at. Right?",35:02,Sondland
367,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t know if he brought it up specifically, but asked where the aid was I think was more … I think he sort of asked, again, very vague recollection because I don’t have a readout of the bilateral meeting, but why don’t I have my check, essentially?",35:08,Sondland
368,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you understood the Ukrainians received no credible explanation, is that right?",35:25,Sondland
369,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I certainly didn’t, couldn’t give them one.",35:31,Sondland
370,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So, is this kind of a two plus two equals four conclusion that you reached?",35:33,Sondland
371,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Pretty much.,35:39,Sondland
372,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Is the only logical conclusion to you that, given all of these factors, that the aid was also a part of this quid pro quo?",35:41,Sondland
373,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yep.,35:48,Sondland
374,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now, I want to go back to that conversation that you had with Vice President Pence right before that meeting in Warsaw. You indicated that you said to him that you were concerned that the delay in the aid was tied to the issue of investigations. Is that right?",35:51,Sondland
375,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t know exactly what I said to him. This was a briefing attended by many people and I was invited at the very last minute. I wasn’t scheduled to be there, but I think I spoke up at some point late in the meeting and said, “It looks like everything is being held up until these statements get made.” And that’s my personal belief.",36:10,Sondland
376,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And Vice President Pence just nodded his head?,36:31,Sondland
377,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I don’t recall any exchange or where he asked me any questions. I think he, it was sort of a duly noted.",36:34,Sondland
378,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Well he didn’t say, “Gordon, what are you talking about?”",36:41,Sondland
379,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, he did not.",36:44,Sondland
380,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"He didn’t say, “What investigations?”",36:45,Sondland
381,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He did not.,36:49,Sondland
382,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now, after this meeting, you discussed this a pull aside, you had with Mr. Yermak where you relayed your belief that they needed to announce these investigations prior to the aid being released. Is that right?",36:54,Sondland
383,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I said I didn’t know exactly why, but this could be a reason.",37:09,Sondland
384,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And obviously you had been speaking with Mr. Yermak for quite a while about a public announcement of these investigations. Right?,37:16,Sondland
385,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"We had all been working on toward that end, yeah.",37:22,Sondland
386,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And so, you indicated to him that in addition to the White House meeting, security aid was now also involved in that.",37:25,Sondland
387,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"As I said, I said it could have been involved, yes.",37:32,Sondland
388,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now, I’m going to show you another text exchange you had on September 1st where Ambassador Taylor says to you, “Are we now saying that security assistance and White House meeting are conditioned on investigations?” And you respond, “Call me.” Ambassador Taylor recalls that he did call you and you did have a conversation, and in that conversation you told Ambassador Taylor that the announcement of these investigations by President Zelensky needed to be public and that that announcement was conditioned on, that announcement would ultimately release the aid. Do you recall that conversation with Ambassador Taylor?",37:35,Sondland
389,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, my conversation with Ambassador Taylor, my conversation with Senator Johnson were all my personal belief just based on, as you put it, two plus two equals four.",38:21,Sondland
390,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Well, in his testimony, Ambassador Taylor says that you said that President Trump had told you that he wanted President Zelensky to state publicly as of September 1st. Do you have any reason to doubt Ambassador Taylor’s testimony, which he said was based on his meticulous contemporaneous notes?",38:32,Sondland
391,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"President Trump never told me directly that the aid was conditioned on the meetings. The only thing we got directly from Giuliani was that the Burisma and 2016 elections were conditioned on the White House meeting. The aid was my own personal, guess based again on your analogy, two plus two equals four.",38:52,Sondland
392,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So, you didn’t talk to President Trump when Ambassador Taylor says that that’s what you told him? Is that your testimony here?",39:18,Sondland
393,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,My testimony as I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement of elections.,39:24,Sondland
394,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So, you never heard those specific words-",39:32,Sondland
395,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,39:35,Sondland
396,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Right? But-,39:35,Sondland
397,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Never heard those words.,39:36,Sondland
398,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And, well, let’s move ahead because you have another conversation a little bit later that both Tim Morrison and Ambassador Taylor recount. But in this September 1st conversation, Ambassador Taylor also testified under oath that you said that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Do you recall using that expression?",39:37,Sondland
399,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah. It goes back to my earlier comment that again, coming from the Giuliani source, because we didn’t discuss this specifically with president Trump, that they wanted whatever commitments Ukraine made to be made publicly so that they would be on the record and be held more accountable. Whatever those commitments were.",40:02,Sondland
400,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"You also testified, or Ambassador Taylor rather, testified that you told him that you had made a mistake in telling the Ukrainians that only the White House meeting was conditioned on the announcement of the investigations, and that in fact everything was, including the security assistance. Do you remember saying that?",40:23,Sondland
401,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"When I referenced a mistake, what I recall was I thought that a statement made by the new Ukrainian prosecutor, that these investigations would be started up again or commenced, would be sufficient to satisfy Mr. Giuliani/ President Trump. As I recall, my mistake was, someone came back through Volcker otherwise and said, “No, it’s not going to do if the prosecutor makes these statements. The president wants to hear it from Zelensky directly.” That’s the mistake I think I made.",40:42,Sondland
402,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes?,41:17,Sondland
403,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’m not going to question or not question. I’m just telling you what I believe I was was referring to.,41:23,Sondland
404,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange which may help refresh your recollection. On September 8th, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Can you read what you wrote there?",41:30,Sondland
405,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"“Guys, multiple convos with Zelensky POTUS. Let’s talk.”",41:43,Sondland
406,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And so, this was September 8th at 11:20 in the morning and Ambassador Taylor responds immediately, “Now is fine with me.” And if we could go to the next exchange, Ambassador Taylor then, 15 minutes later says, “Gordon and I just spoke,” or 20 minutes later rather, “I can brief you if you and Gordon don’t connect,” speaking to Ambassador Volker. Then Ambassador Taylor an hour later says, “The nightmare is they give the interview and don’t get the security assistance. The Russians love it and I quit.” You would agree that in this text message after you had spoken earlier, an hour earlier with Ambassador Taylor that he is linking the security assistance to this interview, this public announcement by President Zelensky. Is that right?",41:47,Sondland
407,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Absolutely.,42:33,Sondland
408,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And in fact, Ambassador Taylor testified that you did have a conversation with him at that point, and that you told him that just as your text message indicates, you did have a conversation with President Trump prior to that text message. Does that help to refresh your recollection that you in fact spoke to President Trump at that time?",42:34,Sondland
409,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I don’t recall President Trump ever talking to me about any security assistance ever. What this tells me, refreshing my memory, is that by the 8th of September it was abundantly clear to everyone that there was a link and that we were discussing the chicken and egg issue of, should the Ukrainians go out on a ledge and make the statement that President Trump wanted them to make and then they still don’t get their White House visit and their aid, that would be really bad for our credibility. I think that’s what he was referring to.",42:56,Sondland
410,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So, you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump as you indicated in that text, right?",43:36,Sondland
411,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"If I said I did, I did.",43:42,Sondland
412,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And that after that conversation, you were still under the impression that the aid was contingent on these public announcements?",43:43,Sondland
413,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I did not get that from President Trump, but I was under the impression that absolutely it was contingent-",43:51,Sondland
414,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Well, you weren’t dissuaded then. Right? Because you still thought that the aid was conditioned on the public announcement of the investigations, after speaking to President Trump.",43:56,Sondland
415,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,By September 8th I was absolutely convinced it was.,44:05,Sondland
416,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And President Trump did not dissuade you of that in the conversation that you acknowledge you had with him?,44:09,Sondland
417,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t ever recall, because that would have changed my entire calculus. If President Trump had told me directly, “I’m not-",44:14,Sondland
418,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"That’s not what I’m asking Ambassador Sondland. I’m just saying, you still believed that the security assistance was conditioned on the investigation after you spoke to President Trump? Yes or no.",44:21,Sondland
419,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"From a timeframe standpoint, yes.",44:31,Sondland
420,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now, Ambassador Taylor also testified that, and Mr. Morrison, both of them testified, that you told them that President Trump said there was no quid pro quo, which you also included in that text message that you’re referred. But then you went on and they had slight variations as to what you told them, but then you said that, to Ambassador Taylor, that President Zelensky himself, not the prosecutor general, needed to clear things up in public or there would be a stalemate, and Mr. Morrison recounted something similar. You don’t have any reason to doubt that both of their very similar recollections of the conversations they had with you, do you Ambassador Sondland?",44:34,Sondland
421,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Let me break that down. Mr Goldman. The text, as I said, about the no quid pro quo was my effort to respond to Ambassador Taylor’s concerns to go to President Trump. Apparently Ambassador Taylor had access to Secretary Pompeo, He did not have access to President Trump. So, I made the phone call. I said, what do you want? President Trump responded with what I put in the text and then I strongly encouraged Ambassador Taylor to take it up with the secretary, and he responded, “I agree,” when I said that.",45:15,Sondland
422,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"As far as the other part of your question, relating to whether or not the prosecutor could make the statement or Zelensky could make the statement, I don’t recall who told me, whether it was Volker, whether it was Giuliani or whether it was President Trump, “It’s got to be Zelensky, it can’t be the prosecutor.” But that’s what I relayed. Whoever I got that information from, I relayed that to, I believe, both Mr., Or, excuse me, Ambassador Taylor and to Mr. Morrison.",45:54,Sondland
423,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"But as of September 9th you understood, did you not, that President Trump, either himself or through his agents, required that President Zelensky make a public announcement of the two investigations that President Trump cared about in order to get both the White House meeting and to release the security assistance. Is that correct?",46:23,Sondland
424,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I believe that is correct.,46:43,Sondland
425,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Mr. Chairman, I yield back.",46:45,Sondland
426,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"That concludes our 45 minutes. I now recognize Mr. Nunes. Oh, okay. Why don’t we take a five or 10 minute break.",46:47,Sondland
427,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Thank you.,46:55,Sondland
428,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"This is your, this is what you said about your conversation with the president, so this is your words about what the president told you.",54:37,Sondland
429,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,This is the May 23rd meeting?,54:45,Sondland
430,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"That’s correct. “They are all corrupt. They’re all terrible people. And you know, I don’t want to spend any time with that.” And he also said, “They tried to take me down.”",54:48,Sondland
431,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,54:59,Sondland
432,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"When they tried to take him down, I think any logical person that wants to do two plus two equals four games would say, that was in the 2016 election, wasn’t it?",55:02,Sondland
433,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I believe that’s what he was referring to, yes. Right, ranking member.",55:15,Sondland
434,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"So, during all this time, and remember in the spring, the Democrats’ Russia hoax witch hunt is still ongoing. They’re still claiming that President Trump is a Russian agent. They’re out to get President Trump at the time. His personal attorney is then interested in trying to figure out, “Okay, who are these Ukrainians that are trying to get to my candidate?” As those of us, the Republicans on this committee, who are also trying to get to the bottom of who were the sources in the Steele dossier that the Democrats had paid for? The House Republicans wanted to know that all through the spring and even the summer of, and even as of today, we’d still like to know.",55:18,Sondland
435,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"That’s why we’ve subpoenaed the DNC operatives that they refuse to subpoena. We sent a letter this morning. I doubt we’ll see those subpoenas. We want to know exactly, get to the bottom of exactly who are these democratic operatives that were dirtying up the Trump campaign in 2016. And they just can’t get over that the president would send his personal attorney over there to try and get to the bottom of that. And Ambassador, you had very few dealings with Rudy Giuliani, a few text messages …",56:01,Sondland
436,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,A few text messages and a few phone calls. Right.,56:32,Sondland
437,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"So, the whistleblower, trying to put together here with their timeline, they seem to have a timeline problem, because the whistleblower that only they know, who they won’t subpoena, who clearly Mr. Vindman knows who they block testimony yesterday from and would not allow Mr. Vindman to answer our questions. That whistleblower says on July 25th that there were all these promises being made. Yet the … I forgot what they call it, the drug deal that the three amigos were cooking up seems to be their latest, you’re part of the three amigos and the drug deal, Ambassador. Were you aware of any drug deal on July 25th when the phone call actually occurred?",56:36,Sondland
438,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know about any drug deal.,57:25,Sondland
439,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Right, and did you know you’re a part of the three Amigos?",57:27,Sondland
440,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I am. I am a proud part of the three Amigos.,57:31,Sondland
441,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"And that’s the same thing Ambassador Volker said yesterday. Because, by the time the phone call that supposedly the whistleblower claims was the reason, was the original quid pro quo has now got down to, we’re now a month later where you’re involved and their quid pro quo has gotten down to down to the low level of, “Well, they want a statement.” And you didn’t even know about anything to do with, on July 25th you knew nothing about military aid being withheld.",57:33,Sondland
442,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I knew military aid was withheld beginning, I believe, on July 18th when Ambassador Taylor told both of us that that was the case.",58:08,Sondland
443,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"But on July, but you don’t know about, you are not on the July 25th call.",58:17,Sondland
444,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I was not.,58:20,Sondland
445,Section_3,Devin Nunes,Where the aid doesn’t come up at all.,58:21,Sondland
446,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I just read the readout when everyone else did-",58:25,Sondland
447,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"We’ve had, everybody’s testified that was on the July 25th call, that there was no aid discussed on the July 25th call. So then, you’re in the process, you have no idea that this is tied to Burisma or anybody else. You say you don’t realize that until end of August.",58:28,Sondland
448,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I didn’t realize that aid was tied. The Burisma and 2016 piece was much earlier, ranking member.",58:46,Sondland
449,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"I’m glad you bring up Burisma, because this is another issue that the Democrats don’t want to go into. They refuse to call in Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden could to get to the bottom of all of this. He could come in and talk about whether or not it was appropriate for him to receive over $50,000 a month while his dad was vice president, and when they actually were able to stop and get an investigator fired. They could call in Hunter Biden, but they don’t want to do it. But, let’s talk about Burisma, Ambassador. I know you’re the Ambassador to the EU. I think some of the members later we’ll get into whether or not it was appropriate for you to be in Ukraine or not. I believe it was. I think you have a clear mandate mandate to do it. But you wouldn’t be the first Ambassador to actually be interested in Burisma. Did you know that in September, 2015 then Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt publicly called for an investigation into Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma? This was the Ukrainian Ambassador appointed by president Obama in Ukraine.",58:57,Sondland
450,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I wasn’t aware of that, no.",01:00:11,Sondland
451,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"You were not aware of it. So, you would not be the first one to be mentioning that investigation should be done on Burisma, because it happened during the Obama administration. Did you know that financial records show Burisma routed more than $3 million to the American accounts tied to Hunter Biden?",01:00:12,Sondland
452,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I did not know that.,01:00:33,Sondland
453,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Did you know that Burisma’s American lawyers tried to secure a meeting with a new state prosecutor the same day his predecessor, Victor Shokin, who the vice president wanted fired, was announced?",01:00:34,Sondland
454,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Did not know that.,01:00:48,Sondland
455,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Well, we’re not going to get to the answer to many of these questions because the witnesses that need to come in and clarify exactly what the Democrats were doing in 2016, we’re not going to be able to visit with those witnesses. And so, it’s an inconvenient truth that the Democrats don’t want to admit. It was their operatives that were dirtying up the Trump campaign using Ukrainian sources in 2016, and they do not want us to get to the bottom of it. They don’t want you, Ambassador, to get to the bottom of it. They don’t want the president’s personal attorney, even though he’s under a special council investigation that they fed into the FBI, that we’ve dealt with for over three years, they don’t want to get you to the bottom of that, Ambassador. I think Mr. Castor has some questions for you.",01:00:52,Sondland
456,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Good morning, Ambassador. How are you?",01:01:43,Sondland
457,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Good morning, Mr. Castor.",01:01:46,Sondland
458,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Welcome back. You’re here all day on the 17th, late into the night, so thank you for your cooperation with the investigation. Did the president ever tell you personally about any preconditions for anything?",01:01:48,Sondland
459,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:02:00,Sondland
460,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay, so the president never told you about any preconditions for the aid to be released?",01:02:01,Sondland
461,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:02:06,Sondland
462,Section_3,Steve Castor,The president never told you about any preconditions for a White House meeting?,01:02:07,Sondland
463,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Personally, no.",01:02:11,Sondland
464,Section_3,Steve Castor,"You said you didn’t have your records or your documents from the State Department, but if you did, there wouldn’t be any document or record that ties president Trump personally to any of this. Correct?",01:02:14,Sondland
465,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t want to speculate what would be-,01:02:24,Sondland
466,Section_3,Steve Castor,Your documents or records.,01:02:26,Sondland
467,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall anything like-,01:02:28,Sondland
468,Section_3,Steve Castor,"okay, good heavens. Okay, you testified Mr. Giuliani’s requests for a quid pro quo for the White House meeting, and you indicated that you believe that was, he was evincing President Trump’s interests, correct?",01:02:29,Sondland
469,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"My contact with Mr. Giuliani began, as I said, very late in the process after August 1st, when I was first introduced to him by a text from Ambassador Volker. So, we had already begun those discussions, I believe, with the Ukrainians prior to August 1st, so everything was being funneled through others, including Mr. Volker.",01:02:51,Sondland
470,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay, but you testified that Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president. Correct?",01:03:12,Sondland
471,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"That’s our understanding, yes.",01:03:19,Sondland
472,Section_3,Steve Castor,"But, how did you know that? Who told you?",01:03:22,Sondland
473,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, when the president says, “Talk to my personal attorney,” and then Mr. Giuliani, as his personal attorney, makes certain requests or demands, we assume it’s coming from the president. I’m not testifying that I heard the president tell Mr. Giuliani to tell us. So, if that’s your question …",01:03:23,Sondland
474,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Right, but at your deposition, you said the question was at the May 23rd meeting, when the president said, “Go talk to, go talk to Rudy,” you responded, “He didn’t even say go talk. [inaudible 01:03:55] talk to Rudy.” You subsequently said, “It was sort of like, I don’t want to talk about this.” So, it wasn’t an order or a direction to go talk with …",01:03:42,Sondland
475,Section_3,Steve Castor,"I want to talk about this. So it wasn’t an order or a direction to go talk with Mr. Giuliani, correct?",01:04:03,Sondland
476,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Our conclusion and the conclusion of the three of us was that if we did not talk to Rudy, nothing would move forward on Ukraine.",01:04:06,Sondland
477,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. And then that was May 23rd and then you never had any personal communications with Giuliani until August, right?",01:04:13,Sondland
478,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:04:19,Sondland
479,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And Volcker was handling, Ambassador Volker was he the primary- [crosstalk 01:04:25].",01:04:21,Sondland
480,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Volker, Perry and others.",01:04:26,Sondland
481,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. Ambassador Volker, you testified he’s a professional diplomat, correct?",01:04:27,Sondland
482,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yes, he is.",01:04:35,Sondland
483,Section_3,Steve Castor,And you said you had a great relationship with him?,01:04:35,Sondland
484,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I do, yes.",01:04:38,Sondland
485,Section_3,Steve Castor,You said he was a very smart guy.,01:04:39,Sondland
486,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:04:41,Sondland
487,Section_3,Steve Castor,Ambassador Ivanovich said he’s a brilliant diplomat in fact. Do you agree with that?,01:04:42,Sondland
488,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"He is pretty, pretty smart.",01:04:47,Sondland
489,Section_3,Steve Castor,You stated that he’s one of those people I’d hand my wallet too.,01:04:49,Sondland
490,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I would.,01:04:54,Sondland
491,Section_3,Steve Castor,And so did you hear his testimony yesterday?,01:04:56,Sondland
492,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I did not.,01:04:58,Sondland
493,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. Because he didn’t-,01:04:58,Sondland
494,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I was busy getting ready for you.,01:05:00,Sondland
495,Section_3,Steve Castor,"He didn’t have any, he didn’t have any evidence of any of these preconditions. And he was the one most engaged with the Ukrainians, wasn’t he?",01:05:03,Sondland
496,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:05:12,Sondland
497,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. I mean, you testified and you know this was his full time job, although he was doing it for free.",01:05:13,Sondland
498,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He was the special envoy.,01:05:18,Sondland
499,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And you testified you came in and out of the events, correct?",01:05:20,Sondland
500,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:05:24,Sondland
501,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. All right. Your deposition and we asked you about your communications with the President and we asked you whether there were so many that it would be impossible to chronicle and you said no, it wasn’t that many, and we went down the path of building a list of communications you remember with the President, right?",01:05:25,Sondland
502,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:05:49,Sondland
503,Section_3,Steve Castor,And we talked about May 23rd and the Oval Office.,01:05:50,Sondland
504,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:05:53,Sondland
505,Section_3,Steve Castor,"You mentioned on July 25th before you went to Ukraine, you called the President, but there was no material information on the 25th call, correct?",01:05:54,Sondland
506,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Not that I recall.,01:06:03,Sondland
507,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. Then the last Friday, Mr. Holmes came in and I guess his testimony refreshed your recollection?",01:06:04,Sondland
508,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yeah. What refreshed my recollection was when he mentioned ASAP Rocky. Then all of a sudden it came back to me.,01:06:12,Sondland
509,Section_3,Steve Castor,And talking about President Zelensky loving the President and so forth.,01:06:19,Sondland
510,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, the whole thing sort of came back to me after he mentioned ASAP Rocky.",01:06:24,Sondland
511,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And then the next time, you know, we tried to unpack this, the next time you talked with the President was on the telephone was September 9th according to your deposition, right?",01:06:28,Sondland
512,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I may have even spoken to him on September 6th but again, I just don’t have all the records. I wish I could get them. Then I could answer your questions very easily.",01:06:39,Sondland
513,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. But in September 9th at least at your deposition, you were extremely clear, you’ve called the President, you said he was feeling cranky that day. Right?",01:06:48,Sondland
514,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He seemed very cranky to me.,01:06:56,Sondland
515,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And you said in no uncertain terms, and this is on the heels of the Bill Taylor text, right?",01:06:57,Sondland
516,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Right.,01:07:03,Sondland
517,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And why don’t you tell us, what did the President say to you on September 9th that you remember?",01:07:04,Sondland
518,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, words to the effect. I decided to ask the President the question in an open ended fashion because there were so many different scenarios floating around as to what was going on with Ukraine. So rather than ask the President nine different questions, is it this? Is it this? Is it that? I just said, what do you want from Ukraine? I may have even used a four letter word and he said, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I just want Zelensky to do the right thing, to do what he ran on” or words to that effect. And that gave me the impetus to respond to Ambassador Taylor with the texts that I sent. As I said to Mr. Goldman, it was not an artfully written text. I should’ve been more specific, put it in quotes, something like that. But basically I wanted Mr. Taylor, Ambassador Taylor to pick up the ball and take it from there. I had gone as far as I could go.",01:07:11,Sondland
519,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And you believe the President, correct?",01:08:08,Sondland
520,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,You know what? I’m not going to characterize whether I believed or didn’t believe. I was just trying to convey what he said on the phone.,01:08:11,Sondland
521,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. And at that point in time the aid was paused for 55 days. There was a news article in Politico on August 28th talking about it. So by that point in time, the President had been receiving calls from senators. He had been getting pressure to lift the aid, correct?",01:08:16,Sondland
522,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s what I understand. Yes.,01:08:37,Sondland
523,Section_3,Steve Castor,"I want to turn back to your opener on page five under, when you talk about in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations, correct?",01:08:42,Sondland
524,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:09:05,Sondland
525,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And you acknowledge that this is speculation, right?",01:09:06,Sondland
526,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It was a presumption.,01:09:11,Sondland
527,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. That it was a guess. In fact, I think you even said this morning-",01:09:13,Sondland
528,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I want to say that it goes back to Mr. Goldman’s point or Chairman Schiff’s two plus two equaled four in my mind at that point.",01:09:18,Sondland
529,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. But you didn’t have any evidence of that, correct?",01:09:27,Sondland
530,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Other than the aid wasn’t being released and we weren’t getting anywhere with the Ukrainians.,01:09:30,Sondland
531,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. But did it Ambassador Volker clue you in that that was the issue? I mean this is a pretty high, I mean this is a pretty serious conclusion you’ve reached without precise evidence.",01:09:34,Sondland
532,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I sent that email to Secretary Pompeo to set up a potential meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky in Warsaw. And when I referred to the log jam, I referred to the logjam in a very inclusive way. Everything was jammed up at that point. And secretary Pompeo essentially gave me the green light to brief President Zelensky about making those announcements.",01:09:46,Sondland
533,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay, we can turn to that. And then that was your email dated what date?",01:10:17,Sondland
534,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Do you have the page there?,01:10:26,Sondland
535,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Well, your email with secretary Pompeo, is that, was that August 11th? 16th.",01:10:29,Sondland
536,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,August 22nd.,01:10:43,Sondland
537,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. So you’re asking secretary Pompeo whether we should block time and I mean, is there any discussion of specific investigations? Is there any discussion of Biden or Barisma or anything linking to aid in this email that you sent to Pompeo? [crosstalk 01:11:06].",01:10:51,Sondland
538,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"This was a proposed briefing that I was going to give President Zelensky and I was going to call President Zelensky and ask him to say what is in this email. And I was asking essentially President Pompeo’s permission to do that, which he said yes.",01:11:04,Sondland
539,Section_3,Steve Castor,"But at that point in time, we’re talking about investigations into the origins of the 2016 election. We’re not talking about anything to do with Joe Biden.",01:11:27,Sondland
540,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Joe Biden did not come up.,01:11:37,Sondland
541,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. Stepping back a page to your email to the state department on August 11th, you emailed Secretary Pompeo and you say, “Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Zelensky to be delivered for our review in a day or two.” And the question I have here is that, I mean that statement never was issued. And in fact, Ambassador Volker has testified that he didn’t think it was a good idea and ultimately the Ukrainians didn’t think it was a good idea. And so the statement never reached a finalized state.",01:11:38,Sondland
542,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:12:17,Sondland
543,Section_3,Steve Castor,But even if it had it doesn’t talk about Biden’s or Barisma or anything insidious.,01:12:19,Sondland
544,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Correct. Well, the statement as I recall, would have mentioned the 2016 election slash DNC server and Barisma.",01:12:26,Sondland
545,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay.,01:12:35,Sondland
546,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It would not have mentioned the Bidens.,01:12:35,Sondland
547,Section_3,Steve Castor,And have you heard Ambassador Volker how he talks about what might be an investigation into Barisma?,01:12:37,Sondland
548,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:12:43,Sondland
549,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. I mean he has said that if there were Ukrainians engaged in violations of Ukrainian law, then the prosecutor general with the new administration ought to investigate that. Did Ambassador Volker ever relate that to you?",01:12:43,Sondland
550,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, we just talked in generic terms about quote investigating Barisma.",01:13:03,Sondland
551,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. But it had nothing to do with the Vice President Biden.,01:13:08,Sondland
552,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I had never heard Vice President Biden come up until very late in the game.,01:13:10,Sondland
553,Section_3,Steve Castor,When?,01:13:15,Sondland
554,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t recall the exact date. But when it all sort of came together, maybe after the transcript of the July 25th call, I don’t know. I don’t know the exact date when I made the connection.",01:13:16,Sondland
555,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay.,01:13:26,Sondland
556,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Apparently a lot of people did not make the connection.,01:13:28,Sondland
557,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. I want to turn to the letter from Senator Johnson. When he heard about some of these issues in the hold of the aid he wanted, he called the President. He called the President on August 31st it’s page six of his letter. Senator Johnson states or he rights, “I asked him, the President whether there was some kind of arrangement where Ukraine would take some action and the hold would be lifted. Without hesitation, President Trump immediately denied such an arrangement existed.” And Senator Johnson quotes the President saying, “No,” and he prefaced it with a different word. “No way. I would never do that. Who told you that? I have,” Senator Johnson says, “I have accurately characterize the President’s reaction is adamant, vehement and angry.” Senator Johnson’s telephone call with the President wasn’t a public event. It was capturing a genuine, you know, moment with the President. And he had at this point in time on August 31st he was adamant, vehement and angry that there was no connections to aid. There were no preconditions.",01:13:31,Sondland
558,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, I had my meeting with Senator Johnson where again, I had made the presumption that I had made to both Mr. Urmach and the email I had sent to secretary Pompeo and we were sort of ruminating about what was going on. Senator Johnson I believe said, “I’m going to call President Trump, you know, and find out.” And then he obviously had that phone call. I wasn’t involved in that phone call.",01:14:48,Sondland
559,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. But you have no reason to disbelieve that wasn’t the way it went down, right?",01:15:12,Sondland
560,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, no reason to disbelieve Senator Johnson.",01:15:17,Sondland
561,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And now that you’ve had some time since your deposition and you submitted an addendum relating to the Warsaw get together with Mr. Urmach, as you sit here today, I mean, are we missing a lot of your communications with the President?",01:15:20,Sondland
562,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I haven’t had that many communications with the President. And in fact a bunch of the call records that I have had access to just the short period of time on the call indicates I never got through. In other words, I was put on hold for one or two minutes and the call never connected. So I really can’t give you an accurate count of how many conversations plus Mr. Caster, I’ve had a lot of conversations with the President about completely unrelated matters that have nothing to do with Ukraine.",01:15:38,Sondland
563,Section_3,Steve Castor,But you don’t think we’re missing any material conversations that you have with the President?,01:16:05,Sondland
564,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall any material conversations today as I’m sitting here.,01:16:10,Sondland
565,Section_3,Steve Castor,Or with Rudy Giuliani.,01:16:14,Sondland
566,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah. My memory about the conversations with Rudy Giuliani, whether they were direct, whether they were conference calls with Ambassador Volker or Secretary Perry is really vague without seeing the, you know, the call logs.",01:16:16,Sondland
567,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Are there any other key fact witnesses that would help us, you know, get to the bottom of whether there was any link to the aid and the-",01:16:34,Sondland
568,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Maybe Brian McCormack, the chief of staff for Secretary Perry who was involved in and out as well.",01:16:44,Sondland
569,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. Now the aid was ultimately lifted on September 11th correct?,01:16:50,Sondland
570,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I believe that’s correct.,01:17:00,Sondland
571,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. And Senator Johnson in his letter on page six quotes the President on August 31st, “Ron, I understand your position. We’re reviewing it now and you’ll probably like my final decision.” So even on August 31st and this is before any congressional investigation started, the President was signaling to Senator Johnson that he was going to lift the aid.",01:17:01,Sondland
572,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,[crosstalk 01:17:29] It sounds like it. Yeah.,01:17:29,Sondland
573,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. And most of the other witnesses we talked to, whether it’s from the Department of Defense or OMB or you know, have told us that all along during this 55 day period, they genuinely believed the hold would be lifted. What was that your feeling too at the time?",01:17:30,Sondland
574,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I didn’t know because every time I asked about the hold, I was never given a straight answer as to why it had been put in place to begin with.",01:17:49,Sondland
575,Section_3,Steve Castor,Now what do you know about the Ukrainians knowledge of the hold?,01:17:57,Sondland
576,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Oh, that’s very vague, I don’t know if the Politico article triggered it. I don’t know if they were told by Mr. Giuliani, it would be pure, you know, guesswork on my part. Speculation. I don’t know.",01:18:01,Sondland
577,Section_3,Steve Castor,I mean during your deposition you testified that you did not believe the Ukrainians were aware of the hold until the Politico article.,01:18:14,Sondland
578,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah. Again, I think I testified that I was not clear on the exact dates of when these things, when the light went on. There were a lot of conversations going on with the Ukrainians by a lot of people. So I don’t know who communicated what to them.",01:18:28,Sondland
579,Section_3,Steve Castor,We have testimony from several witnesses that the President was concerned about foreign aid generally. And so he had an appetite to put holds on aid because he was trying to be a good steward of US tax payer dollars. Do you agree with that?,01:18:45,Sondland
580,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’m aware that that’s been his position on aid and other matters. Yes.,01:19:01,Sondland
581,Section_3,Steve Castor,And are you aware that he was also interested in better understanding the contributions of our European allies?,01:19:06,Sondland
582,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That I’m definitely aware of.,01:19:12,Sondland
583,Section_3,Steve Castor,And there was some back and forth between the state department officials trying to better understand that information for the President.,01:19:13,Sondland
584,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yes, that’s correct.",01:19:20,Sondland
585,Section_3,Steve Castor,And how do you know that wasn’t the reason for the hold?,01:19:21,Sondland
586,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t.,01:19:24,Sondland
587,Section_3,Steve Castor,"But yet you speculate that there was, you know, a link to this announcement?",01:19:26,Sondland
588,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I presumed it, yes.",01:19:34,Sondland
589,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. I want to turn quickly to the July 10th meeting, the July 10th meeting in Ambassador Bolton’s office involving Ambassador Volker, Mr. [Dunnie Luk 00:15:57], Mr. Yara Mark has been the subject of some controversy. Ambassador Volker yesterday testified that it wasn’t until the end of the meeting, Mr. Dunnie Luk said it was going through some real detailed information about some of the plans he had, but it wasn’t until the end of the meeting, Ambassador Volker recollects that you mentioned something general about investigations. What do you remember from that meeting?",01:19:35,Sondland
590,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, again, I’m not going to dispute Ambassador Volker’s recollection, particularly if he had notes. I know that the desire to have the 2016 election DNC server and Barisma were already being discussed by then. Again, I had no direct contact with Mr. Giuliani on July 10th but through Ambassador Volker and I probably mentioned that this needs to happen in order to move the process forward. That seemed to be the conventional wisdom at the time. I don’t recall any abrupt ending of the meeting or people storming out or anything like that. That would have been very memorable if someone had stormed out of a meeting based on something I said.",01:20:26,Sondland
591,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. And nobody accused you at that point in time of being involved with some sort of drug deal?,01:21:15,Sondland
592,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:21:20,Sondland
593,Section_3,Steve Castor,Did Dr. Hill ever relate to you her concerns about you being involved in a drug deal?,01:21:21,Sondland
594,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Never.,01:21:25,Sondland
595,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. So you were surprised when testimony emerged that she thought there was a drug deal going on?,01:21:26,Sondland
596,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I was shocked.,01:21:33,Sondland
597,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And in fact after the meeting you went out and you took a picture, right?",01:21:33,Sondland
598,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, Ambassador Bolton or his assistant indicated that he was out of time, that he needed, he had another meeting to attend and we all walked out of the White House. Everyone was smiling, everyone was happy, and we took a picture on the lawn on a nice sunny day.",01:21:39,Sondland
599,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. Then did you retire to the ward room?,01:21:55,Sondland
600,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think Secretary Perry asked to use the ward room to continue the conversation and the real subject that was under debate, and it wasn’t a angry debate, it was a debate, is should the call from President Trump to President Zelensky be made prior to the parliamentary elections in Ukraine or after the parliamentary elections? And there was good reason for both. We felt Ambassador Perry, Ambassador Volker, and I thought it would help Presidents Zelensky to have President Trump speak to him prior to the parliamentary elections because it would give President Zelensky more credibility and ultimately he would do better with his people in the parliamentary elections. Others I believe, pushed back and said, no, it’s not appropriate to do it before. It should be done after. And ultimately it was done after.",01:22:00,Sondland
601,Section_3,Steve Castor,There was no mention of Vice President Biden in the ward room?,01:22:56,Sondland
602,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Not that I remember, no.",01:22:59,Sondland
603,Section_3,Steve Castor,Or any specific investigation?,01:23:01,Sondland
604,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Just the generic investigations.,01:23:04,Sondland
605,Section_3,Steve Castor,"When again, did the Vice President Biden nexus come to your attention?",01:23:09,Sondland
606,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Very late. Again, I don’t, I can’t recall the exact date the light bulb went on. It could have been as late as once the transcript was out, but it was always Barisma to me and I didn’t know about the connection between Barisma and Biden.",01:23:16,Sondland
607,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And to the best of your knowledge, you never understood that anyone was asking Ukrainians to investigate US persons, correct?",01:23:30,Sondland
608,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Ukrainians to investigate US persons?,01:23:38,Sondland
609,Section_3,Steve Castor,Right?,01:23:40,Sondland
610,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:23:43,Sondland
611,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay.,01:23:43,Sondland
612,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:23:44,Sondland
613,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And just to sort of be clear here, ultimately the aid was lifted on September 11th. There was never any announcement by the Ukrainians about any investigations they were going to do, correct?",01:23:48,Sondland
614,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:24:04,Sondland
615,Section_3,Steve Castor,"The Ukrainians never, to your knowledge, started any of these investigations, correct?",01:24:05,Sondland
616,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Not to my knowledge.,01:24:09,Sondland
617,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And consequently, these allegations that there was a quid pro quo that had to be enforced before the aid is released, that never came to fruition, right?",01:24:11,Sondland
618,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t believe so.,01:24:28,Sondland
619,Section_3,Steve Castor,"I want to just step back a little bit and just verify with you that the President had some deep rooted concerns about corruption in Ukraine, correct?",01:24:40,Sondland
620,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s what he expressed to us. Yes.,01:24:52,Sondland
621,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. And you believed him, right? Given his business dealings in the region?",01:24:53,Sondland
622,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"When we had the conversation, I did.",01:24:57,Sondland
623,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And when you first started discussing the concerns the President had with corruption, Barisma wasn’t the only company that was mentioned right?",01:25:00,Sondland
624,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"It was a generic, as I think I testified to Chairman Schiff, it was a generic corruption, oligarchs, just bad stuff going on in Ukraine.",01:25:11,Sondland
625,Section_3,Steve Castor,"But other companies came up, didn’t they?",01:25:23,Sondland
626,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know if they were mentioned specifically. It might’ve been NAFTA gas because we were working on another issue with NAFTA gas. So that might’ve been one of them.,01:25:28,Sondland
627,Section_3,Steve Castor,"At one point in your deposition, I believe you said yeah, NAFTA gas comes up at every conversation. Is that fair?",01:25:39,Sondland
628,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Probably.,01:25:44,Sondland
629,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. You had, I guess Dr. Hill at one point, attributed to you the terminology that the President has given you a large remit. You familiar with her assertion of that?",01:25:45,Sondland
630,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I didn’t understand what she was talking about.,01:26:03,Sondland
631,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. But you have and we got into this a little bit in your deposition, you know, you said that the President gave you a special assignment with regard to Ukraine, correct?",01:26:04,Sondland
632,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, when the President appointed me as the US ambassador of the European Union, Ukraine was part of my portfolio. What made my assignment larger than just being part of my portfolio were the unique circumstances where there was no current sitting ambassador in Ukraine and there was a new President in Ukraine. The discussions that we had, the three amigos, Perry, Volker and I was that Ukraine needed extraordinary as high level support as it could get from the United States during this period, which we cleared with both Ambassador Bolton and with Chief Of Staff Mulvaney to continue working on it. So by extension, yes. If the national security advisor and the chief of staff approve your remit, it really is coming from the President.",01:26:20,Sondland
633,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. When we asked you that at the deposition, you said I was spinning a little bit.",01:27:16,Sondland
634,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I was spinning about something else I think in the interview in Kiev.,01:27:21,Sondland
635,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay, and you further testified, so when I said the President gave me an assignment, it wasn’t really the President, it was the secretary through the President and that’s where I received my direction. Correct?",01:27:26,Sondland
636,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:27:39,Sondland
637,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. Did Ambassador Taylor ever bring any concerns to your attention about the so called channel he dubbed the irregular?,01:27:40,Sondland
638,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, in fact the opposite. When he came to post, I think I know I called him or he called me, I think he spoke with Secretary Perry and Ambassador Volker separately and in the course of the first few weeks he was highly appreciative that a new ambassador coming to post like himself was getting the kind of support he was getting from all three of us. Having a cabinet member, a special envoy, and a fellow ambassador all helping to raise the profile of Ukraine. He was highly appreciative and highly complimentary.",01:27:53,Sondland
639,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And you maintained an open line with him, correct?",01:28:31,Sondland
640,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Correct. I think there are a number of texts, some of which I have and some of which I don’t, where he is reaching out constantly to me and to the others for advice and help.",01:28:35,Sondland
641,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. We had tried to count them up. There’s 215 or something, text messages between you Volker and ambassador Taylor, you know, during the early August timeframe. Does that make sense to you?",01:28:44,Sondland
642,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I think Taylor started in late June or early July was when he first took post and I think we began communicating fairly shortly thereafter.,01:29:01,Sondland
643,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. And he never communicated any concerns to you during this timeframe that he had issues with what was going on?,01:29:09,Sondland
644,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,What do you mean by what was going on?,01:29:17,Sondland
645,Section_3,Steve Castor,This request for some sort of investigation.,01:29:19,Sondland
646,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Not in the early stages. As time went on, his emails began to be a little more pointed and frantic and that’s when we had very little visibility as to what was going on either. I think it had to do more with the aid and as to why the aid was suspended.",01:29:25,Sondland
647,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Ultimately you put a period on that issue by having the September 9th communication with the President, correct?",01:29:44,Sondland
648,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:29:53,Sondland
649,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And when you shared that feedback with ambassador Taylor, was he satisfied that this issue is now behind them?",01:29:53,Sondland
650,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t really know because he responded when I said, you know, get ahold of the secretary, he said, I agree. And I never knew whether he reached out to the secretary or not. That was sort of the end of that.",01:29:59,Sondland
651,Section_3,Steve Castor,"At one point in your text she said, let’s get on the phone. Right. And you said you’re an individual that doesn’t like to walk through these issues on text when you can talk about it on the telephone, correct?",01:30:10,Sondland
652,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I say that to everybody when something becomes more substantive than just a few lines of text, I say let’s talk.",01:30:21,Sondland
653,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. And did you talk with Ambassador Taylor?,01:30:28,Sondland
654,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t recall. I mean, I don’t recall whether we spoke right after that, whether he called the secretary. Basically, Mr. Caster wanted to get the notion across that I’ve gone as far as I can go with this, you to pick up the, you’re the ambassador. You need to pick up the ball and run with it at this point.",01:30:30,Sondland
655,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. And just getting back to the irregular channel, did anyone else express any concerns to you about this so called irregular channel?",01:30:48,Sondland
656,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I’m not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel. When you’re talking to the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Chief of Staff of the White House, the Secretary of Energy. I don’t know how that’s irregular. If a bunch of folks that are not in that channel are aggrieved for some reason for not being included, I don’t know how they can consider us to be the irregular channel and they to be the regular channel when it’s the leadership that makes the decisions.",01:30:56,Sondland
657,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And so the concerns, you know, raised were never brought to a head?",01:31:33,Sondland
658,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, they were never raised.",01:31:40,Sondland
659,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay.,01:31:42,Sondland
660,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"They were never raised. No one’s said back off of Ukraine, this is dangerous. You’re doing something that’s untoward. We have concerns. There was a bad phone call on July 25th, there’s talk about a drug cocktail or something. No one ever said that to me by phone, by text, by email. I don’t remember anybody sounding any alarm bell because of course had someone mentioned it, I would have sat up and taken notice.",01:31:42,Sondland
661,Section_3,Steve Castor,"When you talk in your statement about in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe, it was your speculation, it was your guess that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of 2016. I believe you said that at this point you believed everyone knew this. Is that correct?",01:32:24,Sondland
662,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think once that Politico article broke, it started making the rounds that, you know, if you can’t get a White House meeting without the statement, what makes you think you’re going to get a $400 million check? Again that was my presumption.",01:32:50,Sondland
663,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. But you had no evidence to prove that, correct?",01:33:05,Sondland
664,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:33:10,Sondland
665,Section_3,Steve Castor,"You stated that you haven’t been able to access your records, is that correct?",01:33:17,Sondland
666,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Not all of them. And there are lots of notes, records, readouts of calls, can’t get to them.",01:33:23,Sondland
667,Section_3,Steve Castor,But you’ve also stated that you don’t take notes. Right?,01:33:31,Sondland
668,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t take notes, but there are a lot of others out there.",01:33:35,Sondland
669,Section_3,Steve Castor,"You freely admit that you, I asked you your deposition, we put together a list of all the times you said you don’t recall. It’s like two pages long.",01:33:41,Sondland
670,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Is that all?,01:33:52,Sondland
671,Section_3,Steve Castor,"So, you know, you don’t on a lot of these questions, I mean there’s nuance, there are ambiguities and we don’t have records, we don’t have notes and we don’t have recollections, correct?",01:33:53,Sondland
672,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Right. I mean it’s situational things that sort of trigger memory, especially when I’m, you know, I’m dealing with the European Union, I’m dealing with the 28 member countries. I’m dealing with other countries that are not in the European Union that are part of my mandate. I’m dealing with the White House leadership. There’s a lot of stuff to juggle. And as I said in my opening statement, a phone call for me with the President of the United States or the President of fill in the blank country, while people who get a call like that, maybe once in a lifetime, a call like that might be very memorable. They might remember every single thing about it. I’m doing that all day long and I’m not saying it in a way of being braggadocio or anything like that, but it’s part of my routine day. So all of these calls, these meetings with very important people tend to sort of blend together until I have someone that can show me what we discussed, what the subject was, then all of a sudden it comes back.",01:34:03,Sondland
673,Section_3,Steve Castor,"I mean, what we’re trying to get to the facts here, we’re trying to find out what actually happened, what’s reliable, what’s accurate. Bill Taylor kept notes. He brought a little notebook in his pocket at his deposition and he held it up and he says, when I’m not at my desk and I’m on the phone, I use this notebook. When I’m at my desk, I use a notebook. George Kent said he wrote just innumerable memos to the file. Catherine Croft, she testified that she didn’t believe George Kent’s notes would be accurate. And so, you know, we have all this, you know, back and forth, but you know as we get to the end here, you don’t have records. You don’t have your notes because you didn’t take notes. You don’t have a lot of recollections. I mean, this is the like the trifecta of unreliability isn’t that true?",01:35:03,Sondland
674,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, what I’m trying to do today is to use the limited information I have to be as forthcoming as possible with you and the rest of the committee. And as these recollections had been refreshed by-",01:35:49,Sondland
675,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"And as these recollections had been refreshed by subsequent testimony by some texts and emails that I’ve now had access to, I think I filled in a lot of blanks.",01:36:03,Sondland
676,Section_3,Steve Castor,"But a lot of it’s speculation, a lot of it is your guess and we’re talking about an impeachment of the President United States. So the evidence here ought to be pretty darn good.",01:36:12,Sondland
677,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I’ve been very clear as to when I was presuming and I was presuming on the aid, on the other things, Mr. Caster, I did have some texts that I read from. So when it comes to those, I’ll rely on those texts because I don’t have any reason to believe that those texts were falsely sent or that there’s some subterfuge there. They are what they are. They say what they say.",01:36:22,Sondland
678,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay, thank you sir.",01:36:45,Sondland
679,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Thank you.,01:36:46,Sondland
680,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Time of the gentleman has expired. We’ll now move to a second staff led round of 30 minutes. Mr. Volker, I just have a few questions before I turn it back to Mr. Goldman. You testified in response to my colleagues in the minority something along the lines of, “A lot of people did not make the connection between Burisma and Biden.” I think a lot of people have real difficulty understanding that. Tim Morrison testified that I think it took him all of doing a Google search to find out, “Oh, this is the significance of Burisma. It involves the Bidens.” Are you saying during all this time, up until the call, you never made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens? You just thought that the president and Rudy Giuliani were interested in this one particular Ukrainian company?",01:36:48,Sondland
681,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, my role Mr. Chairman was just to get the meeting.",01:37:43,Sondland
682,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"I understand that, but my question is, are you saying that for months and months and I was standing everything Rudy Giuliani was saying on TV and all the discussion with Rudy Giuliani that you never put Burisma together with the Bidens?",01:37:48,Sondland
683,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I didn’t and I wasn’t paying attention to what Mr. Giuliani was seeing on TV, we were talking to him directly.",01:38:03,Sondland
684,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Let me ask you this. Ambassador Volker testified yesterday to a similar epiphany, for lack of a better word. This is what he said, “In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company Burisma as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different. The former being appropriate and unremarkable. The latter being unacceptable. In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.” Does that sum up your views as well?",01:38:08,Sondland
685,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It does,01:38:47,Sondland
686,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now I think you were asked a question with a bit of a incorrect premise by my colleagues in the minority about Fiona Hill saying that referring to a drug deal between you and Mr. Mulvaney was Ambassador Bolton who made the comment that he didn’t want to be part of any drug deal that Ambassador Sondland and Mulvaney were cooking up. No one thinks they’re talking about a literal drug deal here or a drug cocktail. The import I think of the ambassador’s comments is quite clear that he believed that this bargain, this quid pro quo, as you’ve described it over a meeting, the investigations to get the meeting was not something he wanted to be a part of.",01:38:53,Sondland
687,Section_3,Adam Schiff,What I want to ask you about is he makes reference in that drug deal to a drug deal cooked up by you and Mulvaney. It’s the reference to Mulvaney that I want to ask you about. You’ve testified that Mulvaney was aware of this quid pro quo of this condition that the Ukrainians had to meet that is announcing these public investigations to get the White House meeting. Is that right?,01:39:45,Sondland
688,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yeah. A lot of people were aware of it and-,01:40:14,Sondland
689,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Including about including Mr. Mulvaney?,01:40:17,Sondland
690,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:40:20,Sondland
691,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And including the secretary of state?,01:40:22,Sondland
692,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:40:24,Sondland
693,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now, have you seen the acting chief of staff’s press conference in which he acknowledged that the military aid was withheld in part because of a desire to get that 2016 investigation you’ve talked about?",01:40:26,Sondland
694,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t think I saw it live. I saw later, yeah.",01:40:44,Sondland
695,Section_3,Adam Schiff,So you saw him acknowledged publicly what you have confirmed too that Mr. Mulvaney understood that two plus two equals four. Is that right?,01:40:48,Sondland
696,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well again, I didn’t know that the aid was conclusively tied. I was presuming he was in a position to say yes it was or no it wasn’t because-",01:40:56,Sondland
697,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And he said yes it was.,01:41:05,Sondland
698,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He said yes it was.,01:41:06,Sondland
699,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Goldman.,01:41:11,Sondland
700,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you again Ambassador Sondland. We do appreciate your efforts to refresh your recollection to the documents and we understand we share your frustration in not having the documents to help guide this investigation. So we do appreciate those efforts. One of the documents that you provided to us goes back to the conversation you and and the chairman were having about Mr. Mulvaney. and you had been trying for some time before the July 25th call to set up that call. Is that right?,01:41:13,Sondland
701,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"To set up the call between President Trump and President Zelensky, yes.",01:41:48,Sondland
702,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Correct. Yes. And I want to show you an email that you reference in your opening statement that is a July 19th email. And who is this from?,01:41:52,Sondland
703,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It looks like it’s… Is it from me? I don’t know.,01:42:12,Sondland
704,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"It’s from you, I believe.",01:42:16,Sondland
705,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It’s from me to to the group.,01:42:17,Sondland
706,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Now who is the group?,01:42:19,Sondland
707,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"People mentioned on the email? Blair, Kenna, McCormack, Mulvaney, Perry, Pompeo.",01:42:23,Sondland
708,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And who’s Robert Blair?,01:42:30,Sondland
709,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I believe he’s a deputy chief of staff or a advisor to the chief of staff.,01:42:32,Sondland
710,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And you’ve already told us that Lisa Kenna is the executive secretary for secretary Pompeo. Who’s Brian McCormack?,01:42:39,Sondland
711,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He was was the chief of staff for Secretary Perry.,01:42:46,Sondland
712,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And then we see Mr. Mulvaney, Secretary Perry and Secretary Pompeo. Can you read what you wrote on July 19th to this group please?",01:42:50,Sondland
713,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He is prepared to receive POTUS’ call will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation. We’ll turn over every stone. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so he can put out some media about a friendly and productive call. No details prior to Ukraine election on Sunday.,01:43:05,Sondland
714,Section_3,Dan Goldman,So Sunday was the 21st which was the date of the parliamentary elections in Ukraine. Is that right?,01:43:25,Sondland
715,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,01:43:30,Sondland
716,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Okay. When you say, “Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will, ‘turn over every stone,'” what do you mean there?",01:43:31,Sondland
717,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’m referring to the Burisma and the 2016 / DNC server investigations.,01:43:43,Sondland
718,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Later that evening, Secretary Perry responds just to you and Brian McCormack saying, “Mick, just confirm the call being set up for tomorrow by NSCRP.” And then a little later, Mr. Mulvaney replies to all saying, “I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow.” Were these the only responses that you received to this email?",01:43:50,Sondland
719,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t know. If I have them, I would show them. I don’t know.",01:44:17,Sondland
720,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"No one wrote back to you and said, “What are you talking about in terms of these investigations and turning over every stone?”",01:44:22,Sondland
721,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, there was a chain, and I don’t know if it’s part of this email or a subsequent email where I believe Ambassador Bolton pushed back and said he did not want a call to President Zelensky made by President Trump until after the parliamentary elections.",01:44:28,Sondland
722,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So that would explain why it was moved from the next day, July 20th to the 25th right?",01:44:47,Sondland
723,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,01:44:52,Sondland
724,Section_3,Dan Goldman,But Ambassador Bolton is not on this is he?,01:44:53,Sondland
725,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t think he is, no.",01:44:56,Sondland
726,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Now you were asked by Mr. Caster if there are any other key witnesses who might be able to help with our investigation and you mentioned Brian McCormack. The chief of staff for Secretary Perry.,01:44:57,Sondland
727,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I did.,01:45:09,Sondland
728,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"You are aware that the committee subpoenaed him, are you not?",01:45:10,Sondland
729,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I wasn’t aware of that.,01:45:13,Sondland
730,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And that he refused to come testify. Are you also aware that Mr Mulvaney was subpoenaed by the committee and refused to come testify?,01:45:14,Sondland
731,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I did read that in the newspaper, yes.",01:45:22,Sondland
732,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Are you also aware that Robert Blair was subpoenaed and refused to come testify?,01:45:24,Sondland
733,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think I’m aware of that, yeah.",01:45:29,Sondland
734,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And that Secretary Perry was asked to come testify and refused.,01:45:30,Sondland
735,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I am aware of that as well.,01:45:34,Sondland
736,Section_3,Dan Goldman,So would you include them include as well as Secretary Pompeo as key witnesses that would be able to provide some additional information on this inquiry?,01:45:35,Sondland
737,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I think they would.,01:45:47,Sondland
738,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now this was not the first time, as you indicated, that Mr. Mulvaney heard about these investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election. Is that right?",01:45:49,Sondland
739,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know what Mr. Mulvaney heard or didn’t hear. I think there’s been a huge amount of exaggeration over my contact with Mr. Mulvaney. It was actually quite limited.,01:46:05,Sondland
740,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Well, he certainly didn’t indicate… He certainly indicated a familiarity with what you were talking about in this July 19th email. Is that right?",01:46:16,Sondland
741,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Right, because I think Mr. Mulvaney was in the May 23rd briefing with President Trump. I don’t remember because there were people sitting behind us that were coming and going when we were sitting in front of President Trump’s desk.",01:46:23,Sondland
742,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Okay. Now you’ve said that you don’t have a recollection of referencing Mulvaney in the July 10th meeting and Ambassador Bolton’s office. Is that right or-,01:46:37,Sondland
743,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall.,01:46:48,Sondland
744,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So when both Fiona Hill and Colonel Vindman testified that in response to a question from Ukrainian officials at that July 10th meeting about scheduling a White House visit that you said, “Well I spoke with Mr. Mulvaney and it will be scheduled after they announce these investigations.” Do you have any reason to dispute that characterization?",01:46:51,Sondland
745,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t have any reason to agree or dispute. I just don’t remember.,01:47:18,Sondland
746,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So if they both remembered it and they both then went and spoke to the NSC legal advisor about it, you would trust that whatever they relay to the NSC legal advisor would likely be an accurate reflection?",01:47:21,Sondland
747,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I trust that they related to the NSC legal advisor. I don’t know whether I said it and I don’t know which conversation… Again, I’ve had very, very limited conversations with Mr. Mulvaney.",01:47:32,Sondland
748,Section_3,Dan Goldman,This email indicates that you spoke to President Zelensky and were relaying what he said to very senior officials. Is that right?,01:47:45,Sondland
749,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Which email again?,01:47:56,Sondland
750,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Sorry, the July 19th email. Where you say, the subject is, “I talked to Zelensky just now.”",01:47:57,Sondland
751,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes. I got it.,01:48:04,Sondland
752,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Was there some sort of assurance that President Zelensky needed to provide about what he would say to President Trump in order just to get the phone call?,01:48:08,Sondland
753,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think that part was verbal and then there were a lot of communications going around back and forth with the Ukrainians and that’s when someone, and I don’t remember who, came up with the idea of a draft statement, so there would be no misunderstanding about what in fact the Ukrainians would say and would be willing to say that we could rely on and negotiate something on a piece of paper.",01:48:23,Sondland
754,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So just to place you in time, we’re going to get to that draft statement, which was in August, this is July 19th before the July 25th call. Do you remember whether there was a need from any of the White House officials or other national security officials for President Zelensky to provide some assurance of what he would say to President Trump before a phone call? Not the meeting, but a phone call was scheduled.",01:48:53,Sondland
755,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"There was initially apparently a condition, but that condition was obviously dropped because the phone call took place and there was no such statement made. The phone call took place as you said on the 25th of July.",01:49:21,Sondland
756,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And when you say there was no such statement that took place, what do you mean?",01:49:35,Sondland
757,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Well the Ukrainians never made their public statement prior to the phone call on the 25th of July.,01:49:39,Sondland
758,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Right, but we’re not talking about a public statement. What I was asking is whether President Zelensky needed to relay to you or the other American officials that he would assure President Trump that he would do these investigations in a phone call. That is-",01:49:45,Sondland
759,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"In my email, I obviously had just spoken with him and he being Zelensky, and he said that he was prepared to receive the call and he would make those assurances to President Trump on that call. And then presumably that would then lead to the White House meeting.",01:50:05,Sondland
760,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you had been discussing this phone call for several weeks now, is that right?",01:50:26,Sondland
761,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yes. With Volcker, with Perry, with Giuliani through Volcker and Perry.",01:50:31,Sondland
762,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And then right after you sent this email assuring the others that he will discuss the investigations and we’ll turn over every stone, the Burisma in 2016 election investigations, Mr. Mulvaney responded that he asked to set up the call for the next day. Is that right?",01:50:39,Sondland
763,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s what it says.,01:50:59,Sondland
764,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now let’s go to that press statement that you were discussing in August and you testified, I believe, that you understood that Rudy Giuliani was representing the president’s interests with regard to Ukraine. Is that right?",01:51:00,Sondland
765,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s what we all understood.,01:51:17,Sondland
766,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And when you all, who do you mean we all?",01:51:19,Sondland
767,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, myself.",01:51:21,Sondland
768,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"In August, you and Ambassador Volker were coordinating with Andriy Yermak, the Zelensky aid, about a press statement. And I want to pull up some of the text exchanges that you were referring to, which as you acknowledge, helps you refresh your recollection. Is that right?",01:51:26,Sondland
769,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,And I think Taylor was involved in those initial discussions as well.,01:51:46,Sondland
770,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Well, he’s not on any of these text messages, so perhaps he was, he does not remember that. But let’s go to the first one. Is it working? On August 9th? There’s an exchange between Ambassador Volker and you where you are discussing setting up, we’ll try to bring it up in a second, but I’ll just summarize for you. You’re discussing trying to set up a White House meeting. Here it is. And you say Morrison, “Ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms.” Ambassador Volker says, “Excellent, how did you sway him?” You said, “Not sure I did. I think POTUS really wants the deliverable.” What did you mean there?",01:51:49,Sondland
771,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,The commitment to do the investigations.,01:52:40,Sondland
772,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And how did you know that the president wanted the deliverable?,01:52:43,Sondland
773,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t recall. I may have had a conversation with him or I may have heard it from someone else, but I don’t recall. Again, without all these records.",01:52:47,Sondland
774,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Going to the next exhibit, exhibit 10, or August 10th rather. This is between you and Andriy Yermak. What did you say initially in this exchange?",01:52:57,Sondland
775,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Hello? Good, my prop… Oh no, that’s Yermak. “How was your conversation?”",01:53:13,Sondland
776,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And Mr. Yermak responds, “Hello, good. My proposal, we received date and then we make general statement with discussed things. Once we have a date, we’ll call for a press briefing announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of U.S. Ukraine relationship, including among other things, Burisma and election meddling and investigations.” And you respond, “Got it.” That was your understanding of what the statement had to say to satisfy Mr. Giuliani, is that right?",01:53:17,Sondland
777,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:53:45,Sondland
778,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And then ultimately to satisfy the POTUS deliverable?,01:53:45,Sondland
779,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:53:48,Sondland
780,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Now the next day you write an email to Ulrich Brechbuhl and Lisa Kenna. Are you able to see that on your-,01:53:50,Sondland
781,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, I can see it on the screen, yeah.",01:54:05,Sondland
782,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Okay. What is the subject of the email?,01:54:07,Sondland
783,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Ukraine.,01:54:12,Sondland
784,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And can you read what you wrote there?,01:54:13,Sondland
785,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"“Mike,” and I’m referring to Secretary Pompeo, “Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Zelensky to be delivered for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation. Zelensky plans to have a big presser on the openness subject, including specifics next week.”",01:54:17,Sondland
786,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And in your opening statement you said that the specifics… What did the specifics represent?,01:54:40,Sondland
787,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,The 2016 and the Burisma.,01:54:46,Sondland
788,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And when you say the boss, who do you mean by that?",01:54:49,Sondland
789,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,President Trump.,01:54:51,Sondland
790,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And the invitation is what?,01:54:52,Sondland
791,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,To the white house meeting.,01:54:54,Sondland
792,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And Lisa Kenner responds, “Gordon, I’ll pass to S.” And S is Secretary Pompeo?",01:54:57,Sondland
793,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:55:02,Sondland
794,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Thank you, Lisa. Now two days later, you have a text exchange with Ambassador Volker again, and this is at the end of it, but the earlier text, which we don’t have here, you may recall includes the press statement, the revised press statement that includes Burisma and the 2016 election. Do you recall that?",01:55:03,Sondland
795,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yes. If I could see it, that would be helpful. But yes.",01:55:32,Sondland
796,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"But you ultimately remembered that after your conversation with Mr. Giuliani, you did pass along a statement to the Ukrainians that included Burisma and the 2016 election. Is that right?",01:55:37,Sondland
797,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think there were statements being passed back and forth between Volker, the Ukrainians, and others to try and negotiate acceptable language.",01:55:49,Sondland
798,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And ultimately the statement was not issued, was it?",01:55:59,Sondland
799,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:56:01,Sondland
800,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And the White House meeting did not-,01:56:02,Sondland
801,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Still hasn’t occurred.,01:56:04,Sondland
802,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Still hasn’t occurred. But you certainly understood at that time, did you not, that it was the President’s direction and instruction that a White House meeting with presidents Zelensky would not occur until President Zelensky announced publicly the investigations that the president wanted, is that right?",01:56:05,Sondland
803,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:56:28,Sondland
804,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you now know that the investigations the president wanted, was an investigation into the Bidens and an investigation into the 2016 election?",01:56:29,Sondland
805,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I know that now, yes.",01:56:37,Sondland
806,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"I’m going to move ahead to August 22nd and you wrote an email to secretary Pompeo, directly to secretary Pompeo CC-ing Lisa Kenna with the subject of Zelensky. And could you please read what you wrote to secretary Pompeo?",01:56:42,Sondland
807,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Mike, should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull aside for POTUS to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look them in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place mid September, Zelensky should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to POTUS and to the U.S. Hopefully that will break the log jam.",01:57:05,Sondland
808,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And secretary Pompeo responds to you three minutes later. “Yes.” Now I want to unpack this a little bit. You said that in the middle, “Once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place.” What did you mean by that?",01:57:32,Sondland
809,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"The new prosecutor that was going to be working for President Zelensky. The old prosecutor, I believe his term was up or he was being let go, he was the Poroshenko prosecutor and Zelensky wanted to wait until his person was in place.",01:57:49,Sondland
810,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So once that new prosecutor was in place, then Z, President Zelensky, “Should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to POTUS.” What did you mean by those issues of importance to POTUS?",01:58:06,Sondland
811,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, the 2016 election and Burisma investigation.",01:58:21,Sondland
812,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Were you aware at this time that secretary Pompeo had listened in to the July 25th phone call?,01:58:24,Sondland
813,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I was not.,01:58:30,Sondland
814,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"If he had, do you believe that he would fully understand what the issues of importance to POTUS related to Ukraine would be?",01:58:31,Sondland
815,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I mean, I can’t characterize his state of mind. He listened in on the phone call and he concluded what he concluded.",01:58:39,Sondland
816,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"But now that you’ve read the phone call, it’s quite clear what the issues of importance to POTUS are.",01:58:46,Sondland
817,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:58:50,Sondland
818,Section_3,Dan Goldman,By an investigation and the 2016 election investigation. Is that right?,01:58:51,Sondland
819,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:58:55,Sondland
820,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Then it says, “Hopefully that will break the log jam.” Now, by this point, you were aware that security assistance had been on hold for about five weeks. Is that right?",01:58:57,Sondland
821,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I became aware on the 18th of July.,01:59:08,Sondland
822,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And you understood that there was a lot of activity within the state department and elsewhere to try to get that hold lifted. Is that right?,01:59:11,Sondland
823,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,01:59:21,Sondland
824,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Just about everybody in the inner agency, meaning the national security apparatus, wanted to lift the hold and wanted the aid to go to Ukraine?",01:59:22,Sondland
825,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:59:30,Sondland
826,Section_3,Dan Goldman,So what did you mean here when you said log jam?,01:59:32,Sondland
827,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, as I said to chairman Schiff, I meant inclusively anything that was holding up moving forward on the meeting and the Ukraine U.S. relationship.",01:59:35,Sondland
828,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And what was holding that up?,01:59:48,Sondland
829,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"At that point, it was the statements about Burisma and the 2016 elections.",01:59:50,Sondland
830,Section_3,Dan Goldman,But what was being held up?,01:59:59,Sondland
831,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, the aid was being held up, obviously",02:00:00,Sondland
832,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Four days later, you said in your opening statement that you sent Rudy Giuliani’s contact information to John Bolton. Is that right?",02:00:04,Sondland
833,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I did.,02:00:11,Sondland
834,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Did you know why he asked for that?,02:00:11,Sondland
835,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No idea.,02:00:13,Sondland
836,Section_3,Dan Goldman,Did you know that he was going to Ukraine the next day?,02:00:14,Sondland
837,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I knew he was about to go to Ukraine. I didn’t know exactly when his trip was, but I thought it was kind of an odd request given that the White House can pretty much get anyone’s phone number they want.",02:00:17,Sondland
838,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now in this email to Secretary Pompeo, you reference a trip to Warsaw. Ultimately the Vice President went on that trip.",02:00:29,Sondland
839,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,02:00:36,Sondland
840,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And that was the conversation that you’ve talked about where you testified earlier to that where you said that we really need to get these investigations from Ukraine in order to release the aid in the pre meeting.,02:00:36,Sondland
841,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,02:00:51,Sondland
842,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And Vice President Pence just nodded?,02:00:53,Sondland
843,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He heard what I said.,02:00:57,Sondland
844,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And didn’t respond in any way.,02:00:58,Sondland
845,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall any substantive response.,02:01:00,Sondland
846,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Okay, but you never specifically referenced the Bidens or Burisma in that meeting, did you?",02:01:03,Sondland
847,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t remember ever mentioning the Bidens. I may have mentioned Burisma.,02:01:10,Sondland
848,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And that meeting was with a group. You were not alone with Vice President Pence.,02:01:15,Sondland
849,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,02:01:18,Sondland
850,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you know that at that bilateral meeting with President Zelensky, I believe you testified earlier, that Vice President Pence did not mention these investigations at all, right?",02:01:21,Sondland
851,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall him mentioning the investigations.,02:01:33,Sondland
852,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So your testimony is just simply in a pre meeting with a group of Americans before the bilateral meeting, you referenced the fact that Ukraine needed to do these investigations in order to lift the aid.",02:01:36,Sondland
853,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think I referenced, I didn’t say that Ukraine had to do the investigations, I think I said that we heard from Mr. Giuliani that that was the case.",02:01:51,Sondland
854,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So that helped inform your presumption, correct?",02:02:00,Sondland
855,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,02:02:03,Sondland
856,Section_3,Dan Goldman,So it wasn’t really a presumption you heard from Mr. Giuliani?,02:02:04,Sondland
857,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I didn’t hear from Mr. Giuliani about the aid. I heard about the Burisma in 2016",02:02:08,Sondland
858,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you understood at that point as we discussed, two plus two equals four that the aid was there as well.",02:02:14,Sondland
859,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"That was the problem, Mr. Goldman. No one told me directly that the aid was tied to anything. I was presuming it was.",02:02:20,Sondland
860,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Right. Well, I want to go ahead to… I want to go back on September 1st… Or I’m going to jump actually ahead to September 7th okay. When we discussed those text messages where you said there were multiple convos with President Zelensky and POTUS, you recall that?",02:02:28,Sondland
861,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Do you have the email by any chance?,02:02:53,Sondland
862,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"We could try to pull it up in a second, but you don’t remember? I showed it to you this morning.",02:02:56,Sondland
863,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, go ahead though with your question.",02:02:59,Sondland
864,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And you confirmed that that likely meant, as you said it did, that you spoke with President Trump. Is that right?",02:03:00,Sondland
865,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, if my email said I spoke with President Trump, presumably I did.",02:03:09,Sondland
866,Section_3,Dan Goldman,You are relying pretty heavily in your testimony on the texts and emails that you are able to review. Is that right?,02:03:14,Sondland
867,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,02:03:19,Sondland
868,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So certainly if someone else had contemporaneous texts, emails or notes, you would presume that what they were saying was accurate. Is that correct?",02:03:20,Sondland
869,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, if they had texts or emails, I would if they had notes, I don’t know. Some people’s notes are great, some people’s aren’t. I don’t know.",02:03:29,Sondland
870,Section_3,Dan Goldman,But certainly it would be a helpful refresher to anyone’s memory.,02:03:37,Sondland
871,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Including my own.,02:03:41,Sondland
872,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Now you had a conversation on September 7th according to both Ambassador Taylor and Tim Morrison with Tim Morrison, where you told Mr. Morrison that President Trump told you that he was not asking for a quid pro quo, but that he did insist that President Zelensky go to a microphone and say that he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference and that President Zelensky should want to do this himself. You don’t have any reason to dispute both Ambassador Taylor’s and Mr. Morrison’s testimony about that conversation, do you?",02:03:43,Sondland
873,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,02:04:22,Sondland
874,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"On September 8th, you then had a conversation directly with Ambassador Taylor about this same phone call where Ambassador Taylor said that you confirmed that you spoke to President Trump, as he had suggested earlier to you, and that President Trump was adamant that President Zelensky himself, meaning not the prosecutor general, had to, “Clear things up and do it in public.” You don’t have any reason to think that Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his contemporaneous notes was-",02:04:24,Sondland
875,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know if I got that from President Trump or I got it from Giuliani. That’s the part I’m not clear on.,02:04:59,Sondland
876,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Well, Ambassador Taylor is quite clear that you said President Trump, Mr. Morrison is also quite clear that you said President Trump. You don’t have any reason to dispute their very specific recollections, do you?",02:05:06,Sondland
877,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, if they have notes and they recall that, I don’t have any reason to dispute it. I just personally can’t remember where I got it from.",02:05:16,Sondland
878,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And then you also told Ambassador Taylor in that same conversation that if President Zelensky, rather you told President Zelensky and Andriy Yermak that although this was not a quid pro quo as the president had very clearly told you, it was however required for President Zelensky to clear things up in public or there would be a stalemate. You don’t have any reason to dispute Ambassador Taylor’s recollection of that conversation you had with President Zelensky, do you?",02:05:23,Sondland
879,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,02:06:00,Sondland
880,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And that you understood the stalemate referenced the aid, is that correct?",02:06:01,Sondland
881,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"At that point, yes.",02:06:06,Sondland
882,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"Ambassador Taylor also described a comment that you made where you were trying to explain what President Trump’s view of this was. And you said that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks the person to pay up before signing the check. Do you recall saying that to Ambassador Taylor?",02:06:08,Sondland
883,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t recall it specifically, but I may have.",02:06:31,Sondland
884,Section_3,Dan Goldman,And Ambassador Volker also said that you did.,02:06:34,Sondland
885,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Okay.,02:06:37,Sondland
886,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"So just to summarize here, by the end of the first week of September, before the aid had been released, you had expressed twice to the Ukrainians that you understood that the investigations needed to be publicly announced on CNN in order for the aid to be released. Do you recall that?",02:06:38,Sondland
887,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I didn’t say that they had to be announced on CNN. The Ukrainians said to me or to Ambassador Volker or both of us, that they had planned to do an interview anyway on CNN and they would use that occasion to mention these items.",02:07:01,Sondland
888,Section_3,Dan Goldman,"And that even though at some point you had calculated two plus two to equal four and therefore you believed that the aid was conditioned on the investigations, that you had a phone call with President Trump that you relayed to both Tim Morrison and Ambassador Taylor whose accounts of that conversation you do not dispute where President Trump confirmed that President Zelensky needed to publicly announce the investigations or otherwise, the obvious implication of the stalemate would be that the aid would not be released. Is that correct?",02:07:15,Sondland
889,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, the implication, I did not hear…",02:07:51,Sondland
890,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"The foreign aid, but there are people in this town who are in charge of the foreign aid. And, in fact, I don’t think it’s very fair to you at all, or to us, or to the American people. You might be surprised that we had that person here in the Capitol, in a secret deposition, in the basement last Saturday. That testimony might be pretty important to you before you’re here to testify. If you could have read that your lawyers could have went through that because it may have clarified some more things for you about your recollection about the foreign aid.",00:00:00,Sondland
891,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"We had the chair looking at the cameras telling American people, talking about Watergate with their Watergate fantasies that they continue to… I guess they fantasize about this at night, and then they come here and talk about obstruction of justice because they’re not giving you documents that you think you should have. So now they’ve laid out their clear Watergate argument or articles of impeachment. So I just have to remind the gentleman… I know we’re not in a court of law because you wrote the rules, the chair here did. But I would think it’s obstruction of justice to not give the American people and give the ambassador the right to look at the transcript of the man who’s in charge of the foreign aid in this town. Now I could get into what he said, but… Pete, the chair, could release what he said. And we’re not even allowed to call that witness here today.",00:00:45,Sondland
892,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"So let’s talk about things that we do know are facts as best as I think you, and I, and most people know them. President Trump does not like foreign aid to start with. Is that correct, ambassador?",00:01:46,Sondland
893,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I’ve heard that, yes.",00:02:02,Sondland
894,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"And you’ve testified that watching over the EU, you have 28 countries, you have neighboring countries that you work with. One of his biggest complaints is the lack of participation that those countries participate in programs around the world. Isn’t that correct?",00:02:03,Sondland
895,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,00:02:19,Sondland
896,Section_3,Devin Nunes,Especially NATO.,00:02:20,Sondland
897,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,00:02:23,Sondland
898,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Right? When you get directions from the White House when you first became ambassador, probably one of the number one things… I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but on the top of the list was making sure countries pay their fair share, especially with NATO.",00:02:24,Sondland
899,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, and we have a very capable ambassador to NATO, so I’m not going to take her lane.",00:02:42,Sondland
900,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"But you work with those countries, it’s one of the issues that you bring up in your meetings. Correct?",00:02:47,Sondland
901,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It is.,00:02:54,Sondland
902,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"So now I know you weren’t on the July 25th phone call, but one of the first things that the President of the United States brings up is Germany’s lack of participation. I think he names the president of Germany directly. That they’re not participating in helping out Ukraine, who’s one of their neighbors? Is that what you read in the transcript?",00:02:55,Sondland
903,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I’ve heard that, yes.",00:03:18,Sondland
904,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"So the whole idea that the president starting out with, he doesn’t like foreign aid. He doesn’t think countries pay their fair share. That’s looking out for the taxpayer. But there’s more. And we talked about this in your deposition. We talked about how we have requirements. The Congress writes requirements into the law that require you and all the diplomats to carry out the foreign policy of this country for the President of the United States. Before the president can certify foreign aid and send foreign aid, there has to be certification that there’s no corruption. You’re aware of that now?",00:03:20,Sondland
905,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I am now. Yes.,00:04:00,Sondland
906,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"So being that you learned about that in your deposition. Now looking back at clearly the challenges and concerns the president had with the involvement of high-level Ukrainian government officials, including the ambassador here in the United States that attacked him during his presidential campaign, the concerns of leaks that were leaks or just made up stories and conspiracy theories that were spun in the Steele dossier that the Democrats on this committee own… They paid for it. Other DNC operatives that were working with the Ukrainian ambassador here in Washington, D.C. to dirty up your boss, the President of the United States.",00:04:04,Sondland
907,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"We’re not going to hear from those witnesses, just like we’re not going to hear from the person we deposed on Saturday. We’re not going to hear about what the real reason the person who’s in charge of making sure that foreign aid is delivered… We’re not going to hear about what actually happened with the foreign aid. Wouldn’t that have made it a lot easier for you to testify instead of guessing and doing little funny math problems up here. Two plus two equals four. It’s great for all the viewers to hear that. Wouldn’t be easier if you just knew exactly why the foreign aid wasn’t given.",00:04:50,Sondland
908,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It would’ve been easier to testify if I had a totality of the record.,00:05:30,Sondland
909,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"And would you trust the person who’s in charge of cutting the checks for foreign aid, the top career diplomat or the the top career official?",00:05:34,Sondland
910,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’d have no reason not to.,00:05:43,Sondland
911,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Thank you. On that, sir, I don’t know if we’ll get to speak again if we have some more magical minutes, but I’m done with questions with you. I know the rest of our members have more questions. I know Mr. Caster has some more questions.",00:05:46,Sondland
912,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Hello again, Ambassador.",00:06:04,Sondland
913,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Hi.,00:06:06,Sondland
914,Section_3,Steve Castor,"We’ll try not to use all of this time as a courtesy to you. I just want to go through some distinctions between your opener, and your deposition, and some other witnesses. In your opening statement today you said, “President Trump directed us to talk with Rudy.” Correct?",00:06:07,Sondland
915,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:06:27,Sondland
916,Section_3,Steve Castor,"But then you and I had a little bit of a back and forth about the president just said, “Talk to Rudy.” And I believe, and correct me if I’m wrong, you took that to mean if we wanted to move forward with these types of things Rudy was the place to go?",00:06:27,Sondland
917,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Rudy was the guy.,00:06:42,Sondland
918,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. But President Trump didn’t direct you to talk to Rudy. Correct?,00:06:43,Sondland
919,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"It wasn’t an order. It was, “If you want to work on this, this is the guy you got to talk to.”",00:06:48,Sondland
920,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Ambassador Volker in his deposition said, “I didn’t take it as an instruction, but just as a comment.” “Talk to Rudy. He knows these things and you’ve got some bad people around them.” I mean, referring to the Ukrainian, so I mean, Ambassador Volker hasn’t testified that there’s any sort of order or direction, “Talk to Rudy.”",00:06:56,Sondland
921,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t know what he testified. It became very clear to all three of us that if we wanted to move the relationship forward, President Trump was not really interested in engaging. He wanted Rudy to handle it. And, as I said in my opening statement, Secretary Perry took the lead and made the initial contact with Rudy. And that’s when we began working with him.",00:07:20,Sondland
922,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And as to the question of whether Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desire specifically of the President of the United States, in your deposition you said, “I don’t know. I don’t know if this was coming out of Rudy Giuliani irrespective of the president.” Correct?",00:07:46,Sondland
923,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yeah. I’m not going to dispute what I said in my deposition. It’s true. Yeah.,00:08:00,Sondland
924,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And we walked through all your communications with Rudy Giuliani. And they’re not a lot, right?",00:08:03,Sondland
925,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:08:07,Sondland
926,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Ambassador Volker in his deposition on the same question said, “I did not have that impression. I believe Mr. Giuliani was doing his own communications.” And, granted, Mr. Giuliani had business interest in Ukraine. Correct?",00:08:10,Sondland
927,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Now I understand he did. I didn’t know that at the time.,00:08:24,Sondland
928,Section_3,Steve Castor,"With [inaudible 00:08:27] Parnas and Fruman, correct?",00:08:27,Sondland
929,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Lot of new names I’ve learned.,00:08:31,Sondland
930,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. And you had never met with those folks?,00:08:32,Sondland
931,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,00:08:34,Sondland
932,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And then in your September 9th communication with the president, during your deposition that was a striking moment when you walked us through your telephone call with President Trump on September 9th.",00:08:42,Sondland
933,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"And, by the way, I cannot find a record of that call because the State Department and the White House cannot locate it. But I’m pretty sure I had the call on that day.",00:08:54,Sondland
934,Section_3,Steve Castor,"But whether it was the 9th or the 8th, you had this call. And it was extremely memorable, right?",00:09:02,Sondland
935,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It was.,00:09:09,Sondland
936,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And you’ve been very honest, and we’re not trying to give you a hard time on all the times you don’t recall. We’re just trying to just say that a lot of important events that have happened that the Committee’s asked you about, and you’ve honestly said, “I don’t recall.”",00:09:10,Sondland
937,Section_3,Steve Castor,"But the call was President Trump on September 9th or the 8th you recall it vividly, right?",00:09:24,Sondland
938,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I recall it vividly because it was keyed by the sort of frantic emails from Ambassador Taylor. I had, again, prior to that call, had all kinds of theories as to why things weren’t moving, why there was no White House meeting, why there was no aid, why there was no this, why there was no that. And I was getting tired of going around in circles, frankly. So I made the call. And I asked, as I said, the open-ended question, “What do you want from Ukraine?” And that’s when I got the answer.",00:09:30,Sondland
939,Section_3,Steve Castor,"He was unequivocal, “Nothing.”",00:10:00,Sondland
940,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,What I said in the text is what I heard.,00:10:03,Sondland
941,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And I’m curious, was that vignette in your opener today?",00:10:05,Sondland
942,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t think so.,00:10:11,Sondland
943,Section_3,Steve Castor,How come? It’s so memorable. So striking.,00:10:12,Sondland
944,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know. It was in my previous testimony. And I assumed if people had questions they would bring it up.,00:10:18,Sondland
945,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. I mean this is an example. A lot of witnesses during the course of this investigation have dealt with ambiguity’s in different ways. And some have resolved them in the least favorable to the president over and over again. This is an exculpatory fact shedding some light on the president’s state of mind about the situation about the-,00:10:24,Sondland
946,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,And I’m happy to discuss it.,00:10:48,Sondland
947,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Yeah, so I’m just wondering why you didn’t mention it in your opener?",00:10:50,Sondland
948,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"There were so many things I wanted to do include in my opening. And my opening was already, I think, 45 minutes or something. It would have been an hour and a half. There are a lot of things I’d like to have mentioned-",00:10:53,Sondland
949,Section_3,Steve Castor,But you only had a couple conversations with the president. And we’re trying to evaluate whether the-,00:11:04,Sondland
950,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It was not purposeful. Trust me.,00:11:09,Sondland
951,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. Talking about striking conversations. Mr. Holmes, when he came here last Friday in the basement, he, I’ll tell you, he thought your conversation that you had with the president was like the most memorable thing he’s ever experienced. He=",00:11:12,Sondland
952,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,How many conversations as he had with the president?,00:11:31,Sondland
953,Section_3,Steve Castor,"He probably hasn’t had any, but he was energized, enthusiastic about telling us about this conversation.",00:11:35,Sondland
954,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"So not only did I buy him lunch, but I also provided entertainment?",00:11:45,Sondland
955,Section_3,Steve Castor,"I mean he conferred with us that he regaled anyone that he came across with this story. And that’s, I guess, a great discussion for Thursday. But other than the colorful language… And he was definitely moved by the color.",00:11:49,Sondland
956,Section_3,Steve Castor,"But he was unequivocal that you brought up the Bidens in the post call discussion. And he said something to the effect of the president’s only interested in big things. And Mr. Holmes said that, “Oh, there’s a lot of big things going on in the Ukraine.” Like there are. There’s a war. Ukraine’s under attack from the East by Russia. And he puts words in your mouth to the effect of, “No, the president only cares about investigations like Rudy is pitching about the Bidens.”",00:12:11,Sondland
957,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And what’s important about this, this is the day after the 7:25 call. And what’s reported by Mr. Holmes and you, the extent you’ve confirmed it, isn’t anything different than happened on the 7:25 call. Agreed? From the president’s standpoint?",00:12:48,Sondland
958,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"With 20/20 hindsight now that we’ve had the transcript of the call, the Bidens were clearly mentioned on the call. I wasn’t making the connection with the Bidens.",00:13:06,Sondland
959,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Right, but with regard to the president, it was just mentioning investigations.",00:13:15,Sondland
960,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"That’s all he said on the phone was investigations, I think.",00:13:20,Sondland
961,Section_3,Steve Castor,But you told us time and again that you never realized the Bidens were part of any of this. The Barisma. And you talked about a continuum. And you never came to understand that until maybe as late as September 25th. Correct?,00:13:22,Sondland
962,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t know the exact date, but it was pretty late.",00:13:40,Sondland
963,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. And Ambassador Volker said the Biden’s never came up after his one breakfast meeting with Mayor Giuliani where he testified that tried to disabuse the mayor of anything relating to the Bidens.,00:13:42,Sondland
964,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,And I think Secretary Perry publicly stated that he never heard Biden either until the end.,00:13:56,Sondland
965,Section_3,Steve Castor,"So when you testify here today that you have no recollection of mentioning the Biden’s to Mr. Holmes, that’s not just a recollection. That’s based on your state of mind at that point in time and your state of mind up to September 25th. Correct?",00:14:03,Sondland
966,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I wasn’t into investigating the Bidens.,00:14:20,Sondland
967,Section_3,Steve Castor,So it’s very surprising to you that he had mentioned that. Right?,00:14:22,Sondland
968,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It was very surprising to me.,00:14:24,Sondland
969,Section_3,Steve Castor,"I want to go back to a couple of things in your statement. This July 26th meeting with President Zelensky earlier in the day from this lunch-time event we’ve been talking about. During the course of the meeting with President Zelensky, did any of the parties discuss what came up on the telephone call?",00:14:31,Sondland
970,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t believe so.,00:14:56,Sondland
971,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. So President Zelensky didn’t express any concerns about the content of the call. Right?,00:14:57,Sondland
972,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I mean, all I heard about that call was that it was a good call. It was friendly. Everyone was happy. I was delighted to hear that so that we could now move to the next phase, which was the meeting.",00:15:02,Sondland
973,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay, so you can tell us with certainty that nobody talked about demands in that meeting or fulfilling the president’s demands.",00:15:15,Sondland
974,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t remember exactly. Again, this is a great example, Mr. Caster of where I would have loved to have seen the notes from the meeting. I didn’t take any notes, but I know there were notes taken. But I don’t remember any heated conversation in the meeting. I remember it being a really, really friendly, good meeting. And that’s why I said what I did to the president the next day, which was, “Zelensky will do whatever you want. He’s very happy.”",00:15:22,Sondland
975,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And you don’t remember any discussion by President’s Zelensky of lamenting how he had to navigate this difficult situation, right?",00:15:52,Sondland
976,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know. I know that that was in the whistleblower complaints. Something about navigating something.,00:16:03,Sondland
977,Section_3,Steve Castor,It was.,00:16:07,Sondland
978,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I didn’t remember anything like that.,00:16:08,Sondland
979,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. And I want to get back to your-,00:16:14,Sondland
980,Section_3,Devin Nunes,Gentleman. Yield just a second.,00:16:17,Sondland
981,Section_3,Steve Castor,Of course.,00:16:18,Sondland
982,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Which would be another helpful thing also, Ambassador, is if we actually had heard from the whistleblower and we had testimony of the whistle blower. Then you wouldn’t have to be up here speculating as much and guessing because you would have a source that would have been interviewed. We have his complaint. We could have matched it up with your testimony, along with the people from OMB that would’ve made it very easy for you to testify. So you wouldn’t have to just try to remember all this stuff and chase conspiracy theories around.",00:16:20,Sondland
983,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"But the Democrats have continued to lay out for the last six weeks moving from quid pro quo, to extortion, to bribery, to… Where’re we at today? Obstruction of justice. And now back to quid pro quo. We wouldn’t have to do all that if the whistleblower would have testified. You wouldn’t have to speculate about what the whistleblower only had in his or her complaint that nobody seems to know. Yield back to Mr. Caster.",00:16:49,Sondland
984,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Thank you, Mr. Nunes. A couple of times in your opener you said everyone was in the loop. These televised proceedings sometimes we lose track of things. And everyone was not in the loop with your speculation or your guess that in the absence of any credible for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur without public statement from the Ukraine. Everyone wasn’t in the loop with that, right?",00:17:17,Sondland
985,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, the secretary was because that’s why I sent my email.",00:18:00,Sondland
986,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Let’s look at your emails. There’s two emails that you sent to the secretary, right? That’re here?",00:18:04,Sondland
987,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,August 22nd?,00:18:22,Sondland
988,Section_3,Steve Castor,Right. And August 11?,00:18:23,Sondland
989,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,August 11?,00:18:25,Sondland
990,Section_3,Steve Castor,"So the August 11th email… We went through this before. I’m sorry to go through it again. You said to the secretary, “Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Z to be delivered for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation. Z plans to have a big presser on the openness subject next week.”",00:18:30,Sondland
991,Section_3,Steve Castor,"A couple of things here. This is only relating to the White House meeting, correct?",00:18:54,Sondland
992,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yes, I believe so.",00:19:01,Sondland
993,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. And this is just investigations generally making a public statement of openness generally, right?",00:19:02,Sondland
994,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well I think by August 11th, Mr. Caster, I think we were talking about 2016 and Barisma. The investigations generally was really early in the-",00:19:11,Sondland
995,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. But do we know that Secretary Pompeo knows that?,00:19:21,Sondland
996,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I think so.,00:19:23,Sondland
997,Section_3,Steve Castor,Why?,00:19:24,Sondland
998,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well only because I think Ambassador, or I’m sorry, Counselor Brechbuhl was briefed on all of these things.",00:19:25,Sondland
999,Section_3,Steve Castor,By who? By you?,00:19:32,Sondland
1000,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"By, I believe, Ambassador Volker, by myself very-",00:19:34,Sondland
1001,Section_3,Steve Castor,That’s not what he testified to. I mean did you-,00:19:39,Sondland
1002,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Ambassador or Counselor Brechbuhl testified? I didn’t know he had-,00:19:42,Sondland
1003,Section_3,Steve Castor,"No, no. Ambassador Volker.",00:19:46,Sondland
1004,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Oh, okay.",00:19:47,Sondland
1005,Section_3,Steve Castor,"He didn’t testify that he briefed Mr. Brechbuhl. I mean this email to the secretary is talking about this statement which… By the way, I mean you said, ” Kurt and I negotiated a statement.” And the statement never went…",00:19:50,Sondland
1006,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Didn’t go anywhere.,00:20:04,Sondland
1007,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Ambassador Volker said it wasn’t a good idea. Mr. [Yamak 00:20:08] said it wasn’t a good idea. And what’s you read to the secretary here it relates to a generic openness subject, right?",00:20:06,Sondland
1008,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah. But I think the secretary, though, was on the July 25th call which, obviously, I wasn’t on and I didn’t know about.",00:20:20,Sondland
1009,Section_3,Steve Castor,But you use this email to suggest that everyone was in the loop that security sector assistance was tied to some act by the Ukrainians.,00:20:27,Sondland
1010,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, no. I don’t think I said that this assistance was involved here.",00:20:37,Sondland
1011,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. So what was everyone in the loop about then?,00:20:44,Sondland
1012,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, the secretary was in the loop that we had negotiated a statement. I’m fairly comfortable that the secretary knows where the statement was at that point. In other words, the 2016 and Barisma. And that Lisa passed that along to him and kept him informed.",00:20:46,Sondland
1013,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. So we can agree that at this point in time the secretary wasn’t in a loop, that there was a conditionality on the security sector assistance.",00:21:08,Sondland
1014,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Hold on a second. Are you asking about July 19th Exhibit 4?,00:21:17,Sondland
1015,Section_3,Steve Castor,I was asking about your email to the secretary on August 11th.,00:21:24,Sondland
1016,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Oh, okay. Well on July 19, which the secretary was on, I talked about fully transparent investigation and turn over every stone. And the secretary was on that.",00:21:29,Sondland
1017,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. But you testified at your deposition that on July 19th in this continuum you talked about, at that point in the continuum it was just a generic investigation. Wasn’t anything involving-",00:21:48,Sondland
1018,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I’m not trying to put words in any [inaudible 00:22:06]. I think it went from the original generic from May 23rd when we left the Oval Office. We’re talking about corruption and oligarchs until Mr. Giuliani started to become involved. Then it transitioned into the Barisma-",00:22:04,Sondland
1019,Section_3,Steve Castor,You hadn’t even talk to Giuliani by that time. This is July 19th.,00:22:22,Sondland
1020,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Mr. Castor, with all respect, will you all Mr. [inaudible 00:22:27]?",00:22:25,Sondland
1021,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Sorry, use the mic.",00:22:28,Sondland
1022,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Will you allow him to finish his answer?,00:22:29,Sondland
1023,Section_3,Steve Castor,Of course. I apologize.,00:22:32,Sondland
1024,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,We were communicating with Mr. Giuliani through Secretary Perry and through Ambassador Volker. I wasn’t talking to Mr. Giuliani directly until after August 1st.,00:22:36,Sondland
1025,Section_3,Steve Castor,But as of July 19th weren’t we still on the generic part of the-,00:22:48,Sondland
1026,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know. I believe by then we were talking about Barisma in 2016 to be candid.,00:22:52,Sondland
1027,Section_3,Steve Castor,But not Biden?,00:22:59,Sondland
1028,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, no, not Biden.",00:23:01,Sondland
1029,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay.,00:23:02,Sondland
1030,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,00:23:03,Sondland
1031,Section_3,Steve Castor,And then turning to your email of August 11th.,00:23:03,Sondland
1032,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yeah. Got it.,00:23:07,Sondland
1033,Section_3,Steve Castor,"I’m sorry, we just dealt with that. August the 22nd.",00:23:10,Sondland
1034,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Twenty-second?,00:23:14,Sondland
1035,Section_3,Steve Castor,Yeah. It’s page 23 of your opener.,00:23:15,Sondland
1036,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah, I got it.",00:23:19,Sondland
1037,Section_3,Steve Castor,And this is where you were requesting a pull aside for the president. And this is when the president was-,00:23:23,Sondland
1038,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He was still going to go.,00:23:34,Sondland
1039,Section_3,Steve Castor,"He was going to go. It was before the hurricane bumped that off his schedule. “I would ask the Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place, Zelensky should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to the President and the United States. Hopefully that’ll break the log jam.”",00:23:35,Sondland
1040,Section_3,Steve Castor,And at this point in time the issues of importance to the president of the United States were what?,00:23:58,Sondland
1041,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,The two investigations.,00:24:06,Sondland
1042,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. But nothing to do with Vice President Biden, right?",00:24:08,Sondland
1043,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I didn’t make the connection then.",00:24:15,Sondland
1044,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. I want to just pivot briefly to the president’s concerns about foreign assistance under Secretary Hale, who will be with us later today, testified that during this relevant timeframe there was a real focus to re-examine all federal aid programs. Are you aware of that interest of the president?",00:24:17,Sondland
1045,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’m generally aware of the president’s skepticism toward foreign aid and conditioning foreign aid on certain things. I’m generally aware of that. Yes.,00:25:01,Sondland
1046,Section_3,Steve Castor,"And Ambassador Hale testified in his testimony, [inaudible 00:25:15] been public, almost a zero based concept that each assistance program in each country that receives the program be evaluated. The program made sense that we avoid nation building and that we not provide assistance to countries that are lost to us in terms of policy, whether it’s because corruption or another reason. Is that something you were aware of it at the time?",00:25:11,Sondland
1047,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Generally, yes.",00:25:42,Sondland
1048,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. And you’re certainly aware that the president was concerned about the European allies’ contributions to the region?,00:25:43,Sondland
1049,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Exactly why I was involved.,00:25:51,Sondland
1050,Section_3,Steve Castor,Okay. So as we get down to September 11th right before the… You’re advocating that the pause be lifted. Correct?,00:25:52,Sondland
1051,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I personally didn’t think the pause should have ever been put in place.,00:26:04,Sondland
1052,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. But as we get down to September 11th, and you’re talking with Senator Johnson, and so forth, you don’t know with certainty that the genuine reason the president was implementing the pause wasn’t because of his concerns about the allies, or his concerns about foreign assistance generally, or that he wasn’t just trying to hold the aid as long as he could to see what type of information he could get about those two subjects.",00:26:06,Sondland
1053,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Fair enough.,00:26:35,Sondland
1054,Section_3,Steve Castor,"Okay. I am really trying to finish up before so I can yield some time back. Do we have anything else, [inaudible 00:26:47]?",00:26:36,Sondland
1055,Section_3,Devin Nunes,I have nothing else.,00:26:48,Sondland
1056,Section_3,Steve Castor,Thank you. Yield back.,00:26:59,Sondland
1057,Section_3,Adam Schiff,The gentleman yields back-,00:27:02,Sondland
1058,Section_3,Steve Castor,Yield back the balance of our time.,00:27:04,Sondland
1059,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Let’s take a 30 minute recess to allow Ambassador Sondland get a bite to eat. I think the members of the committee might like to get a bite to eat. And then we will resume with the member rounds of questioning of five minutes if we could allow the witnesses to have the opportunity to leave the room first.,00:27:08,Sondland
1060,Section_3,Reporter,"Mr. Chairman Ambassador Sondland had intended to fly back to Brussels to resume his duties at the end of the day. And so it would be a great convenience to us if we could have a shorter break now and resume with the member’s questions, and try and wrap up in time that he might be able to make his flight.",00:27:34,Sondland
1061,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"I appreciate that counsel, we all have a busy schedule these days. The member round of questions should take, I think, slightly less than two hours so I think you should be good depending on the time of your flight. But we will endeavor to make the break as short as possible if you’d like to excuse yourself from the room before the rest of the crowd.",00:27:53,Sondland
1062,Section_3,Reporter,"All right. According to Chairman Schiff it might be another two hours of Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the man who Donald Trump appointed as the Ambassador to the European Union.",00:28:32,Sondland
1063,Section_3,Reporter,"The one thing I learned from that session, Camille Foster and [Olivia Nusey 00:28:49], that it all begins and ends with ASAP Rocky. I believe that was the actual quote.",00:28:45,Sondland
1064,Section_3,Speaker 1,Subpoena him.,00:28:55,Sondland
1065,Section_3,Reporter,It ends with the ASAP Rocky.,00:28:56,Sondland
1066,Section_3,Camille,It’s a lot like Watergate in that way.,00:28:57,Sondland
1067,Section_3,Reporter,"He was the ASAP Rocky of Watergate. Camille, what are you taking away from this? I mean, I thought the most interesting bit of this, and I don’t see many people pointing this out, is Stephen Caster, the attorney for Republicans, at one point it turns and says, “You’re an unreliable witness.” And there is that moment where he went from, they’re rewriting their script at the same time, and blatantly says to him, “You’re an unreliable witness.”",00:29:00,Sondland
1068,Section_3,Reporter,The last thing we saw there is Devin Nunez. I wouldn’t say questioning him because then Devin doesn’t seem to question anyone. He speechifies and he gives you these long soliloquies that are… He just wants a cable news show.,00:29:25,Sondland
1069,Section_3,Speaker 1,"Ukraine election [crosstalk 00:00:29:40], et cetera.",00:29:38,Sondland
1070,Section_3,Reporter,"You can ask, “Come on Devin. You can come on this one.” And he goes on, and on, and on, and… But it was an attack-",00:29:39,Sondland
1071,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Ask just a few questions and our staff because the expanded round hadn’t had time to get through much of what I wanted to ask you Ambassador. But with respect to the statement, you are going back… And I mean by you and others, Ambassador Volker and others, were going back and forth with Ukrainians to figure out what statement they would have to make to get the meeting. Correct?",00:29:45,Sondland
1072,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:30:09,Sondland
1073,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And they understood they were going to have to make this statement publicly in order to get the meeting?,00:30:09,Sondland
1074,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:30:13,Sondland
1075,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Similarly, you testified that pretty much everyone could put two and two together and make four, and understood that the military assistance was also conditioned on the public announcement of these two investigations, correct?",00:30:15,Sondland
1076,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That was my presumption. Yeah.,00:30:29,Sondland
1077,Section_3,Adam Schiff,You put two and two together and you got four is that right?,00:30:30,Sondland
1078,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,00:30:35,Sondland
1079,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now you’re capable of putting two and two together and so are the Ukrainians. They could put two and two together as well? They understood there was a hold on security assistance? There’s testimony that they understood that in July or August, but it was without a doubt, understood when it was made public in the newspaper, they understood that the security assistance was being held up. Right.",00:30:36,Sondland
1080,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know when-,00:31:03,Sondland
1081,Section_3,PART 1 OF 5 ENDS [,],00:31:04,Sondland
1082,Section_3,Adam Schiff,I understood that the security assistance was being held up. Right?,00:31:00,Sondland
1083,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know when they understood it but presumably they did.,00:31:03,Sondland
1084,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Well certainly once it was public they understood the security assistance was withheld. Right?,00:31:07,Sondland
1085,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Once it was public, I assume so, yes.",00:31:11,Sondland
1086,Section_3,Adam Schiff,And indeed that was one of the issues that was brought up in that meeting between Zelensky and Pence in Warsaw.,00:31:13,Sondland
1087,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think as I testified previously, Chairman, I think Zelensky, if I recall asked the question more open ended like when do we get our money?",00:31:20,Sondland
1088,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Well okay. So they understood they didn’t have the money yet. It had been approved by Congress. There was a hold on it. You couldn’t give him any explanation. Is that right?,00:31:29,Sondland
1089,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,00:31:39,Sondland
1090,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"They asked, you couldn’t tell him why it was being withheld. Right?",00:31:39,Sondland
1091,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I could not.,00:31:42,Sondland
1092,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And if they couldn’t put two and two together, you put two and two together for them because you told them, in Warsaw, they were going to need to make that public statement likely to get that aid released. Is that right?",00:31:44,Sondland
1093,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I said I presume that might have to be done in order to get the aid released.,00:31:57,Sondland
1094,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Because we’ve had a lot of a lot of argumentation here. Well the Ukrainians didn’t know the aid was withheld, but the Ukrainians found out, and then it was made abundantly clear if they hadn’t put two and two together themselves that if they wanted that aid they were going to have to make these statements correct?",00:32:00,Sondland
1095,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:32:16,Sondland
1096,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Nunez.,00:32:20,Sondland
1097,Section_3,Devin Nunes,Yield to Mr. Ratcliffe.,00:32:26,Sondland
1098,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"Ambassador Sondland, I’m going to try and quickly move to summarize all of your direct communications with President Trump as it relates to this inquiry, and of course you can correct me if I get it wrong. On May 23rd you had a group meeting that included a, what you called a vanilla request about ending corruption involving Ukrainian oligarchs, correct?",00:32:29,Sondland
1099,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:32:51,Sondland
1100,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"On July 25th you called President Trump to say you were on your way to Ukraine, but nothing of substance occurred on that call, correct?",00:32:52,Sondland
1101,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:33:00,Sondland
1102,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"On July 26, you had a five minute call, a restaurant that you didn’t originally remember because it, according to your statement, this morning, “Did not strike me as significant at the time.” But once refreshed, recalled that the primary purpose was a rapper named ASAP Rocky, correct?",00:33:01,Sondland
1103,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:33:16,Sondland
1104,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"And on September 9th, and most importantly, a reading from your deposition, you called President Trump to ask him, “What do you want from Ukraine?” He responded, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing. I want him to do what he ran on.” And what he ran on was fighting corruption, correct?",00:33:17,Sondland
1105,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:33:36,Sondland
1106,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"And then lastly, on October 2nd, in a random in person meeting that you had an event for the Finnish president, you ran into President Trump and advised him that you’d been called to testify before Congress. And he said to you, “Good. Go tell the truth.”",00:33:38,Sondland
1107,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,00:33:53,Sondland
1108,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,All right. And that is the entirety of your recollection of your direct communications with President Trump about these matters.,00:33:54,Sondland
1109,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I may have had another call or meeting or two. I again, I wish Mr. Ratcliffe, I had the record.",00:34:01,Sondland
1110,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"Understand, but this is what you recall.",00:34:07,Sondland
1111,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,This is what I recall.,00:34:09,Sondland
1112,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"Okay, so stop me if there’s anything sinister or nefarious in any of this. A vanilla request about corruption, a call to say I’m on my way to Ukraine. A five minute call you didn’t remember is significant, but its primary purpose was to discuss a rapper, a call that you made where the president said, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelinsky to do the right thing. I want him to do what he ran on,” and him telling you to go tell Congress the truth. Anything sinister or nefarious about any of that?",00:34:09,Sondland
1113,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Not the way you present it.,00:34:38,Sondland
1114,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"Okay, and that is the truth as you’ve presented it, correct?",00:34:39,Sondland
1115,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:34:42,Sondland
1116,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"All right. Why that’s important Ambassador Sondland, is because none of that is hearsay. None of that is speculation. None of that is opinion. That is direct evidence and ultimately that is what if this proceeds to the Senate they’re going to care about. Unlike this proceeding, which has been based on largely speculation and presumption and opinion. This is direct testimony and direct evidence.",00:34:43,Sondland
1117,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"And to that point, none of that included evidence about the Bidens and none of that included evidence about military assistance because President Trump never mentioned either of those to you, correct?",00:35:08,Sondland
1118,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,00:35:18,Sondland
1119,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"So going back to the July 26th call, because it’s going to be a spectacle tomorrow, you didn’t remember it because it didn’t strike you as significant at the time. Is it fair to say that if the President of United States was asking you to do or say something improper or unlawful, that would have been significant to you?",00:35:20,Sondland
1120,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,00:35:38,Sondland
1121,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"All right, and if that call was part of a bribery or extortion scheme that you were part of as Democrats have alleged, you’d remember that as significant, wouldn’t you?",00:35:39,Sondland
1122,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I was not a part and I would have remembered.,00:35:49,Sondland
1123,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"I understand that and I agree with you. Let’s turn to the quid pro quo, because it’s been reported in the papers that this was blockbuster testimony today about quid pro quo in new evidence. To be fair to you, Ambassador Sondland, according to your statement today, as you say on page 14, as you testified previously, this was your opinion that there was a quid pro quo, correct?",00:35:50,Sondland
1124,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"The 2016 Burisma and the, excuse me, the 2016 election and Burisma in return for the White House meeting. That’s correct.",00:36:20,Sondland
1125,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"So you’ve shared that before. To that point, to be clear again on the part of it that relates to military assistance, though, you don’t have any direct evidence from President Trump about that part of it. That’s your two plus two part of the equation, right? The presumption, correct?",00:36:30,Sondland
1126,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:36:47,Sondland
1127,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"All right, and you understand also that others disagreed. Yesterday we heard from Mr. Morrison, Ambassador Volker, they testified that they didn’t see a quid pro quo. Do you understand that?",00:36:49,Sondland
1128,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I understand that that’s what they said.,00:37:00,Sondland
1129,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"Reasonable people could look at all of this and come to different conclusions, correct?",00:37:01,Sondland
1130,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:37:07,Sondland
1131,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,I yield back.,00:37:08,Sondland
1132,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Himes.,00:37:12,Sondland
1133,Section_3,Jim Himes,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ambassador, thank you for testifying. Ambassador, a couple of things jumped out at me in your testimony. In your opening statement. You say, Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election, DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the President.",00:37:12,Sondland
1134,Section_3,Jim Himes,"That last sentence is interesting. No conditionality, no modifiers. Mr Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of United States, Mr. Giuliani communicates in colorful and memorable terms. What did Mr. Giuliani say to you that caused you to say that he is expressing the desires of the President of the United States?",00:37:35,Sondland
1135,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Mr. Himes, when that was originally communicated, that was before I was in touch with Mr. Giuliani directly. So this all came through Mr. Volker and others.",00:37:56,Sondland
1136,Section_3,Jim Himes,So Mr. Volker told you that he was expressing the desires of the President of the United States.,00:38:05,Sondland
1137,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:38:12,Sondland
1138,Section_3,Jim Himes,"And subsequently when you saw the transcript of the July 25th conversation with President Zelensky, you put it all together and yeah, this is the desire of the President of the United States.",00:38:12,Sondland
1139,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,After I saw the July 25th rewrite.,00:38:22,Sondland
1140,Section_3,Jim Himes,"Okay. Other thing that is interesting here, the theme of your testimony today is that everybody knew and signed off, which is a little different from what we’ve heard, right? We’ve heard this from others saying that your effort out there was irregular. It was a shadow foreign policy characterized as a drug deal, and by the way, that was not a democratic characterization despite what Mr. Nunez says.",00:38:24,Sondland
1141,Section_3,Jim Himes,"That of course was the National Security Advisor of the United States characterizing it as a drug deal. What confuses me is that you have said and testified, and it’s in here, that the Secretary of State was not only aware, but that he applauded you. Good work, keep banging away. The Secretary of State, if this had been irregular or a drug deal or a shadow foreign policy, he would have been the one to put an end to it and yet he did not, right?",00:38:49,Sondland
1142,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, the Secretary of State I think was taking into account the totality of what I had been working on globally and saying you’re doing a great job including this.",00:39:14,Sondland
1143,Section_3,Jim Himes,Right. Okay. So he was aware of what you were doing and you’re doing a great job includes this.,00:39:24,Sondland
1144,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,00:39:29,Sondland
1145,Section_3,Jim Himes,So in some sense he was validating it rather than saying this was irregular or shadow or a drug deal.,00:39:29,Sondland
1146,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,We never thought it was irregular. We thought it was in the center lane.,00:39:34,Sondland
1147,Section_3,Jim Himes,"And why do you think the Secretary of State thought that? [crosstalk 00:39:42] Why did he think that this was a worthy thing to do when so many senior people, including the National Security Advisor thought it was a drug deal?",00:39:38,Sondland
1148,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know. You’d have to ask him.,00:39:49,Sondland
1149,Section_3,Jim Himes,"Okay. To your knowledge, did he have communications with the President about this?",00:39:51,Sondland
1150,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I have no knowledge of his communications with the President.,00:39:57,Sondland
1151,Section_3,Jim Himes,"Okay. Let me take you to the July 26 call that we’ve talked a little bit about. You basically haven’t disputed Mr. Holmes’s characterization to that report, although perhaps the mention of Biden, you don’t recall that. I’m actually pretty confident we’ll get a transcript of that call. A conversation in public between a high profile Ambassador and the President of the United States will be the top target, not for one, but for many foreign intelligence services.",00:40:00,Sondland
1152,Section_3,Jim Himes,"And because it’s pretty sensitive stuff to this inquiry and pretty sensitive stuff because this information could be used to embarrass the President or leverage public officials. My guess is we’re going to see the transcript. Our people are pretty good, and if other people have it, we’re going to see this transcript. Until then, all we’ve got is your recollection and the testimony of the other people there. So I’m curious about your frame of mind.",00:40:28,Sondland
1153,Section_3,Jim Himes,"This statement, Ambassador Sondland agreed that the President did not give a fig, not the word used, about Ukraine. Is that a statement you might make? Do you believe that the President doesn’t give a fig about Ukraine?",00:40:53,Sondland
1154,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Are you, Congressman referring to the call or you’re referring to my conversation?",00:41:14,Sondland
1155,Section_3,Jim Himes,"So Mr. Holmes recounts, and I’ll read it to you. Ambassador Sondland agreed that the President did not give a fig about Ukraine. Fig was not the word you used there. And I’m asking you whether it’s plausible that he might’ve heard that, because I’m asking you whether you believe that the President does not give a fig about Ukraine.",00:41:19,Sondland
1156,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think that’s too strong. I think that based on the May 23rd meeting, the President was down on Ukraine for the reasons mentioned and would need a lot of convincing, and that’s why we’re pushing so hard for the meeting between the President and President Zelensky, because we thought once the two of them would meet his impression of Ukraine, his stock about Ukraine would go up.",00:41:37,Sondland
1157,Section_3,Jim Himes,"And what about this line, Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant “Big stuff that benefits the president.” That’s what you meant by big stuff. So again, we don’t have the transcript. I suspect we will. But is that something you might say? Do you believe that the President really considers big stuff to be that which benefits him?",00:42:02,Sondland
1158,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall saying benefits him.,00:42:21,Sondland
1159,Section_3,Jim Himes,"No, I understand that. I’m not asking what you recalled. I’m asking whether it’s plausible that you might’ve said that because you believe, I’m asking you what you believe right now, that the President doesn’t give a fig about Ukraine and in fact cares about the big stuff that benefits the President. Do you believe that now?",00:42:23,Sondland
1160,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I really can’t opine.,00:42:41,Sondland
1161,Section_3,Jim Himes,I’m not asking for your opinion. I’m asking for your beliefs.,00:42:44,Sondland
1162,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t understand your question. I want to answer your question. I just don’t understand.,00:42:50,Sondland
1163,Section_3,Jim Himes,"Let me try one more. One time. Do you believe, what is alleged that you said on this phone call that the President cares primarily about stuff? The big stuff that benefits the President. Is that a belief [crosstalk 00:43:06].",00:42:51,Sondland
1164,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t think the President said that on the phone call. I don’t think the President said that to me on the phone call. I was talking about the time [crosstalk 00:43:14] ASAP Rocky, and he mentioned investigations. I don’t know why your-",00:43:04,Sondland
1165,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Time with the gentleman has expired. Mr Conaway.,00:43:20,Sondland
1166,Section_3,Mike Conaway,I wish to yield all six minutes to Mr. Jordan.,00:43:24,Sondland
1167,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Ambassador, when did it happen?",00:43:28,Sondland
1168,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,When did what happen?,00:43:32,Sondland
1169,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"The announcement. When did President Zelensky announce that the investigation was going to happen? On page 14 you said this, “Was there a quid pro quo?” Your opening statement, “As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call, White House meeting, the answer is yes.” That there needed to be a public statement from President Zelensky. When the chairman asked you about the security assistance dollars, you said there needed to be a public announcement from Zelensky. So I’m asking you a simple question. When did that happen?",00:43:34,Sondland
1170,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Never did.,00:44:00,Sondland
1171,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"Never did. They got the call July 25th, they got the meeting, not in the White House, but in New York on September 25th. They got the money on September 11th. When did the meeting happen again?",00:44:01,Sondland
1172,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Never did.,00:44:13,Sondland
1173,Section_3,Jim Jordan,You don’t know who was in the meeting?,00:44:14,Sondland
1174,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Which meeting are you referring to?,00:44:16,Sondland
1175,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"The meeting that never happened. Who was in it? [crosstalk 00:44:22] You know how Zelensky announced it? Did he Tweet it? Did he do a press statement? Did he do a press conference? You know how that happened? I mean, you got all three of them wrong. They get the call, they get the meeting, they get the money. It’s not two plus two, it’s 0 for three. I’ve never seen anything like this.",00:44:17,Sondland
1176,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"And you told Mr. Castor that the President never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact, he didn’t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite. The gentleman from Texas just read it. You said to the President of the United States, “What do you want from Ukraine?” The President, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing. I want him to do what he ran on.” What did he run on Ambassador Sondland?",00:44:44,Sondland
1177,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Transparency.,00:45:21,Sondland
1178,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"And dealing with corruption, right?",00:45:23,Sondland
1179,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,00:45:25,Sondland
1180,Section_3,Jim Jordan,Mr. Castor raised another important point. Why didn’t you put that statement in your opening statement? I think you said you couldn’t fit it in. Is that right? So we might be here for 46 minutes instead of 45. [crosstalk 00:45:41].,00:45:26,Sondland
1181,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It wasn’t purposeful trust me.,00:45:41,Sondland
1182,Section_3,Jim Jordan,Wasn’t purposeful?,00:45:43,Sondland
1183,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,00:45:44,Sondland
1184,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"Couldn’t fit it in a 23 page opener. The most important statement about the subject matter at hand, the President unites in a direct conversation with you about the issue at hand, and the President says, let me read it one more time. “What do you want from Ukraine Mr President?” “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.” I want this new guy, brand new guy in politics, his party just took over. I want Zelensky to do the right thing. I want him to run on and do what he ran on, which is deal with corruption. And you can’t find time to fit that in a 23 page opening statement. You know what a quid pro quo is?",00:45:45,Sondland
1185,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I do.,00:46:20,Sondland
1186,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"This for that, right? Looks to me like Ukraine got that three times. There was no this. We didn’t do anything or excuse me, they didn’t have to do anything. I’ve never seen anything like this. When the call came out, you all remember this? When the call came out, everyone said, we’re going to quid pro quo. That was what was in the call. And of course, that didn’t happen. That didn’t happen. Remember what the complaint said?Remember what the memo said, or the whistleblower? This call was frightening. This call was scary. All those things, none of that materialized. None of that materialized. I yield back.",00:46:21,Sondland
1187,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Ms. Sewell.,00:47:16,Sondland
1188,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. I’d like to dig a little deeper in this quid pro quo. Did you not say in your opening statement and in previous testimony in closed door hearing, that you thought there was a quid pro quo?",00:47:17,Sondland
1189,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I thought the quid pro quo was the White House visit in return for the 2016 DNC server and Burisma investigation.,00:47:33,Sondland
1190,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"So when you heard Burisma, you did not see that as code for the Bidens?",00:47:43,Sondland
1191,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I did not.,00:47:50,Sondland
1192,Section_3,Terri Sewell,When did you even know that? Is your testimony that you only realized that Burisma included the Bidens when the readout came out in September 25th?,00:47:51,Sondland
1193,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, my testimony wasn’t specific as to the date, because I really don’t recall the date. It was very late in the game though.",00:48:01,Sondland
1194,Section_3,Terri Sewell,September?,00:48:07,Sondland
1195,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall the date.,00:48:07,Sondland
1196,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"So if I told you that the legal definition of bribery was an event of offering, giving, soliciting, or receiving of any item of value as a means of influencing an action of an individual holding a public or legal duty, do you believe that not only was it quid pro quo, but it was bribery?",00:48:09,Sondland
1197,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’m not a lawyer and I’m not going to characterize what something was or wasn’t legally.,00:48:32,Sondland
1198,Section_3,Terri Sewell,You also said in your opening statement that Secretary Perry and yourself as well as Ambassador Volker worked with Giuliani on the Ukraine matter as an express direction of the President. Is that right?,00:48:37,Sondland
1199,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,00:48:53,Sondland
1200,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"You also go on to say that we did not want to work with Giuliani. Simply put, we played the hand that we were dealt. What did you mean by that? And more importantly, what did you think would happen if you did not play that hand?",00:48:54,Sondland
1201,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think what you’re asking me is, well, you asked it.",00:49:08,Sondland
1202,Section_3,Terri Sewell,I did ask it.,00:49:12,Sondland
1203,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"What would happen if we didn’t. It was very fragile with Ukraine at the time. There was no new ambassador. The old ambassador had had left. There was a new President, and we thought it was very, very important to shore up the relationship.",00:49:14,Sondland
1204,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"In fact, you actually said you go on to say, “We all understood that if we refuse to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relationships with the United States and Ukraine.” So “We followed the President’s orders.” Did you see it as a directive?",00:49:30,Sondland
1205,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I saw it as the only pathway to moving forward on Ukrane.,00:49:48,Sondland
1206,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"So you would say that the efforts that Mr. Giuliani was undertaking became a part of the formal Ukraine, US policy.",00:49:52,Sondland
1207,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I can’t opine on that. All I can tell you is the President wanted us to communicate with Mr. Giuliani.,00:50:02,Sondland
1208,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"But you went on to say that in your opening testimony, that the suggestion that you engaged in some “Irregular or rogue diplomacy,” is absolutely false. So if in fact what Giuliani was doing was okay and proper, which is actually what you said. Initially, you all thought that what he was doing was not improper. Right?",00:50:07,Sondland
1209,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"We did not think it was improper. And when I referred to the fact that I was not engaging in rogue diplomacy, by definition, rogue diplomacy would have meant, I would have not have involved the leadership of the state department and the White House.",00:50:27,Sondland
1210,Section_3,Terri Sewell,So you’re saying that everyone in the chain of command knew about Giuliani’s efforts to try to get the investigations into Burisma … I’m just trying to figure out what you thought you were actually opining to.,00:50:39,Sondland
1211,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Look. The President directed us to work with Mr. Giuliani and the leadership of the state department were knowledgeable as was the NSC that we were working with Mr Giuliani, it’s that simple.",00:50:57,Sondland
1212,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"What’s interesting is that Ambassador Taylor testified that he knew nothing about it. And clearly he would be in the chain of information if he was the Ambassador to Ukraine. At the end of the day, sir, with all due respect, you’re the Ambassador to the European Union. Why would he not know about it? [crosstalk 00:51:25] He was the one who said that there was both a regular and irregular channel.",00:51:08,Sondland
1213,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He should have known about it.,00:51:29,Sondland
1214,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"Although we don’t want, although you said that you did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani, you in fact did work with him.",00:51:32,Sondland
1215,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,00:51:38,Sondland
1216,Section_3,Terri Sewell,And do you think that the essence of what he was trying to achieve was accomplished?,00:51:39,Sondland
1217,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know what he was trying to achieve.,00:51:48,Sondland
1218,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"You clearly had to have known, sir. If you think that this was actually going down the center lane is what you said, it was clearly important that we work with Mr. Giuliani to get what the President asked for because it was a directive and an order. Surely you must know whether or not mission was accomplished.",00:51:49,Sondland
1219,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I know what Mr. Giuliani communicated to us.",00:52:08,Sondland
1220,Section_3,Terri Sewell,And you thought that that was totally fine? Did you really think that it was okay for [crosstalk 00:52:15] Sure.,00:52:12,Sondland
1221,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,You asked what Mr. Giuliani was trying to achieve?,00:52:17,Sondland
1222,Section_3,Terri Sewell,"No. I asked whether you thought that it was right for Mr. Giuliani to want to accomplish the efforts that he was involved in, which was to get them to investigate Burisma and the 2016 election as you said.",00:52:20,Sondland
1223,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,All I can testify to is what I know that Mr. Giuliani either told me directly or told Ambassador Volker and others that was relayed to me.,00:52:36,Sondland
1224,Section_3,Terri Sewell,Thank you. I yield back.,00:52:46,Sondland
1225,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Turner.,00:52:49,Sondland
1226,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"Ambassador Sondland, I want to walk through some of the portions of your testimony because sometimes you seem to make direct connections and sometimes they seem to be dead ends. I kind of want to clear up what are the dead ends and what are the direct connections. Yesterday, Ambassador Volker, who I consider to be very talented and a man of integrity and I believe you think he’s a man of integrity, correct?",00:52:51,Sondland
1227,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I do.,00:53:14,Sondland
1228,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"He testified that the President of United States did not tie either a meeting with the President, a phone call or any aid to investigations of Burisma 2016, or the Bidens. That the President did not do that. And you’ve testified that the President did not tell you that he tied them either. Correct?",00:53:14,Sondland
1229,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I did testify to that. Although when Ambassador Volker and I were working on the statement and negotiating with the Ukrainians, it was Burisma in 2016 that was very clear to Ambassador Volker.",00:53:38,Sondland
1230,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"And how do you know that? What did he say to you? Because he says that was not clear to him. In fact, he says that’s not the case. He was working on that. He knows that’s what the President wanted, but he didn’t have it as this was a requirement.",00:53:57,Sondland
1231,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Oh, I strongly disagree with that portion of his testimony. It was absolutely a requirement, or we would have just had the meeting and been done with it.",00:54:09,Sondland
1232,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"What about the aid? He says that they weren’t tied, that the aid was not tied.",00:54:17,Sondland
1233,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,And I didn’t say they were conclusively tied either. I was presuming it.,00:54:21,Sondland
1234,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"Okay, so the President never told you they were tied. So your testimony, his testimony is consistent in the President and not tie aid to investigations?",00:54:25,Sondland
1235,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,00:54:33,Sondland
1236,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,Okay. He also testified that he spoke to Giuliani and that Giuliani did not relate that he was tying on behalf of the President or on the President’s behalf aid. And then in fact Giuliani never said to him that aid was tied to investigations.,00:54:34,Sondland
1237,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"Now the question I have for you is did you ever have a conversation with Giuliani that did not involve Volker? Because your testimony is a lot of we’s and us’, so do you and Giuliani have a separate conference, separate phone call where Giuliani told you that the aid was tied? Because Volker says and if he was on all your phone calls, Volker says that never happened.",00:54:48,Sondland
1238,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, I did have a few conversations. I don’t recall how many, because I don’t have the records, with Mr. Giuliani directly when Mr. Volcker wasn’t available.",00:55:12,Sondland
1239,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"Did Giuliani say to you, go ahead. What were you going to say?",00:55:21,Sondland
1240,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t believe I testified that Mr. Giuliani told me that aid was tied.,00:55:24,Sondland
1241,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"Oh, see, this is part of the problem Ambassador Sondland, and I just want to walk you through this. Is you’ve said to us, everyone was in the loop and everyone, no, hold on a second. Hold on a second. I’ve listened to you today as a lot of people, and not only are your answers somewhat circular, frequently you’ve contradicted yourself in your own answer.",00:55:28,Sondland
1242,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"Now the text messages and emails that you put up there, Kurt Volker walked us through it. He has a completely different understanding of what you were saying then what you’re saying, you were saying. So I’m a little confused as to how everyone’s in the loop because if Giuliani didn’t give you an express statement, then it can’t be that you believe this from Giuliani. Now, let me tell you right now, is Donald Trump your friend?",00:55:49,Sondland
1243,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, we’re not friends.",00:56:14,Sondland
1244,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,Do you like the President?,00:56:16,Sondland
1245,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,00:56:17,Sondland
1246,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"Okay. Well after you testified, Chairman Schiff ran out and gave a press conference and said he gets to impeach the President of the United States because of your testimony, and if you pull up CNN today, right now their banner says Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid. Is that your testimony today Ambassador Sondland? That you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigations to the aid? Because I don’t think you’re saying that.",00:56:18,Sondland
1247,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I’ve said repeatedly Congressman, I was presuming. I also said that President Trump, [crosstalk 00:56:49]",00:56:41,Sondland
1248,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"Not just the President, Giuliani didn’t tell you, Mulvaney didn’t tell you. Nobody. Pompeo didn’t tell you. Nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct?",00:56:49,Sondland
1249,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I think I already testified-,00:57:04,Sondland
1250,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"No. Answer the question. Is it correct? No one on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying this aid to the investigations. Because if your answer is yes, then the Chairman’s wrong, and the headline on CNN is wrong. No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations, yes or no?",00:57:05,Sondland
1251,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,00:57:23,Sondland
1252,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,So you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations.,00:57:24,Sondland
1253,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Other than my own presumption.,00:57:36,Sondland
1254,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,Which is nothing. I mean that’s what I don’t understand. So you know what hearsay evidence is Ambassador? Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. Do you know what made up testimony is? Made up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean you’re just assuming all of these things and then you’re giving them the evidence that they’re running out and doing press conferences and CNNs headline is saying that you’re saying that the President of the United States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations. And you don’t know that. Correct?,00:57:38,Sondland
1255,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I never said the President of the United States should be impeached.,00:58:04,Sondland
1256,Section_3,Rep Mike Turner,"Nope. But you have left people with the confusing impression that you were giving testimony that you did not. You do not have any evidence that the President of the United States was tied to withholding aid from Ukraine in exchange for investigations, I yield back.",00:58:07,Sondland
1257,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Carson.,00:58:24,Sondland
1258,Section_3,Andre Carson,"Thank you Chairman. Ambassador Sondland, I really want to better understand Mr. Giuliani’s role in carrying out the President’s demand for investigation, so on May the 23rd sir, during a meeting in the oval office to discuss the future of US Korean relations, President Trump told you and others to quote, “Talk to Rudy.” Do I have that right, sir?",00:58:25,Sondland
1259,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:58:45,Sondland
1260,Section_3,Andre Carson,"Mr. Ambassador, did you listen to the President and talk to Rudy sir?",00:58:47,Sondland
1261,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Did I talk to Rudy?,00:58:52,Sondland
1262,Section_3,Andre Carson,Yes sir.,00:58:53,Sondland
1263,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,00:58:53,Sondland
1264,Section_3,Andre Carson,What did you understand to be Mr. Giuliani’s relationship with President Trump?,00:58:55,Sondland
1265,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I understood he was the President’s personal lawyer.,00:58:59,Sondland
1266,Section_3,Andre Carson,What did you believe Mr. Giuliani was doing in the Ukraine for President Trump sir?,00:59:04,Sondland
1267,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know.,00:59:10,Sondland
1268,Section_3,Andre Carson,"Ambassador Sondland, in August of this year, you and Ambassador Volker spoke with Mr. Giuliani about a draft statement to be issued by President Zelensky. During those discussions it was Mr. Giuliani who suggested in fact, insisted that the statement include specific language about Burisma, correct, sir?",00:59:13,Sondland
1269,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:59:33,Sondland
1270,Section_3,Andre Carson,"And he insisted that the statement include the mention of the 2016 elections, and Mr. Volcker transmitted this message to a top Ukrainian official. Right sir?",00:59:34,Sondland
1271,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:59:45,Sondland
1272,Section_3,Andre Carson,"Mr Ambassador, and this statement was part of the deliverable that President Trump wanted correct, sir?",00:59:46,Sondland
1273,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,00:59:52,Sondland
1274,Section_3,Andre Carson,"To your knowledge, sir was pushing the Ukrainians to investigate Burisma 2016, or the Biden’s part of some official state department policy sir?",00:59:54,Sondland
1275,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I never testified that we were pushing anyone to investigate the Bidens. I said, Burisma.",01:00:02,Sondland
1276,Section_3,Andre Carson,"You were involved in Ukrainian policy, right, sir?",01:00:08,Sondland
1277,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I told you what my role was, which was quite limited and focused.",01:00:12,Sondland
1278,Section_3,Andre Carson,"Was it your understanding, Mr. Ambassador, that Ukraine policy should involve investigations into Americans or debunk conspiracy theories about the 2016 election sir?",01:00:16,Sondland
1279,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"What I testified was that in order to get President Zelensky a White House visit, Mr. Giuliani conveyed the notion that President Trump wanted these announcements to happen.",01:00:27,Sondland
1280,Section_3,Andre Carson,"Of course, it was not. It was a part of the President’s political agenda and it was done to benefit the President personally and politically. Were you following the President’s orders, Mr. Ambassador?",01:00:41,Sondland
1281,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I was following the President’s direction to speak with Mr. Giuliani.,01:00:55,Sondland
1282,Section_3,Andre Carson,"Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.",01:00:59,Sondland
1283,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Just to want to point out a couple things Ambassador. In response to my colleagues, my colleagues seem to be under the impression that unless the president spoke the words Ambassador Sondland, I am bribing the Ukrainian president, that there is no evidence of bribery if he didn’t say Ambassador Sondland, I’m telling you I’m not going to give the aid unless they do this. That there’s no evidence of a quid pro quo on military aid.",01:01:01,Sondland
1284,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"But nonetheless Ambassador, you’ve given us a lot of evidence of precisely that conditionality of both the White House meeting and the military assistance. You’ve told us Ambassador, have you not, that you emailed the Secretary of State and said that if these investigations were announced, the new justice person was put in place, that the Ukrainians would be prepared to give the President what he wants.",01:01:35,Sondland
1285,Section_3,PART 2 OF 5 ENDS [,],01:02:04,Sondland
1286,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"The Ukrainians were prepared to give the president what he wants, and that would break the log jam. You’ve testified and showed us documents about this, have you not, Ambassador?",01:02:00,Sondland
1287,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I have.,01:02:10,Sondland
1288,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And in your written statement, you say that the log jam you’re referring to includes the log jam on security assistance, correct?",01:02:11,Sondland
1289,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Correct, as my presumption.",01:02:16,Sondland
1290,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Yes. And we also have seen, and you testified, that you have also seen Ambassador … or rather, acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, himself, acknowledge that the military aid was withheld, in part, over the investigation into 2016 that you’ve talked about. You referenced that as well, correct?",01:02:18,Sondland
1291,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:02:39,Sondland
1292,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now, they also seem to say that, “Well, they got the money. The money may have been conditioned, but they got the money.” Yes, they got caught. They got caught. Now, they still don’t have the White House meeting. They made no statement. They got no meeting. The statement on the investigations was the condition to get the meeting. They didn’t make the statement, they got no meeting. But they got caught. You’re aware, aren’t you, Ambassador, that two days before the aid was lifted, this inexplicable aid was lifted, Congress announced it was investigating this scheme? You’re aware of that, aren’t you, Ambassador?",01:02:43,Sondland
1293,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I am now, yes.",01:03:25,Sondland
1294,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Dr. Wenstrup.,01:03:28,Sondland
1295,Section_3,Brad Wenstrup,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I’d like to address something, a claim that you made this morning, claiming that Republicans deny Russian attempts to influence our elections. That is false, and you know it. In this committee, the intel committee, not the impeachment committee, but in this committee, time and time again, we all agreed that Russia has tried to influence American elections as far back as the Soviet Union. So I wish you would quit making that comment.",01:03:28,Sondland
1296,Section_3,Brad Wenstrup,"Yesterday, we established with Minister Volker something quite obvious. More than one country can try to influence our elections. See, Mr. Schiff, we didn’t agree with your Russian collusion narrative, your DNC Clinton campaign coup attempt, that occurred in conjunction with members of the FBI and DOJ and foreign sources, something that you have conveniently ignored as Chairman of the intelligence committee, as you became the chairman of the impeachment committee.",01:03:55,Sondland
1297,Section_3,Brad Wenstrup,"But in this process today, I’m interested in facts. I’m not a prosecutor or a defense attorney. I’m not an attorney like Mr. Turner. Ambassador Sondland, you honestly have used the words “presumed,” “presumption,” “presuming,” some form of the verb to presume, repeatedly today. And today, you said that was the problem, Mr. Goldman. “No one ever told me the aid was tied to anything. I was presuming it was.” You see, in mathematic fact, two plus two does equal four. But in reality, two presumptions, plus two presumptions, does not equal even one fact. And the fact is the president did tell you, Ambassador Sondland, no quid pro quo. That’s a fact. And another fact, no quid pro quo occurred. This time, I’d like to yield to Mr. Conaway.",01:04:24,Sondland
1298,Section_3,Mike Conaway,"Thank you, gentlemen. Mr. Chairman, I’d like to [inaudible 01:05:26] consent to enter in the record a Washington Post articles from today that’s headlined “Schiff’s Claim That The Whistleblower Has A Statutory Right to Anonymity Received Three Pinocchios,” Pinocchios meaning that … Well, we all know what Pinocchios mean. The interpretation of that would be that, two interpretations, one that my colleagues from the other side would argue, is they were trying to protect the whistleblower. An equally valid, incredible interpretation is that there’s nothing to hide and that this un-level playing field that’s been created by the Chairman’s insistence that there is a statutory right to anonymity, maintains that un-level playing field and the advantages that gives them. Now, the Chairman also announces at every-",01:05:25,Sondland
1299,Section_3,Mike Conaway,"Let’s explore that one. Our own colleague, Congressman Earl Blumenauer from Oregon, has in fact called for a boycott of your hotel chains, or your hotels in Oregon. I’m assuming he believes that that will harm you to the point that you will then be bullied into doing whatever he wants done. Now, my colleagues and I know that using the word “bully” and Earl Blumenauer in the same sentence is a bit over the top. But nevertheless, he intended to harm you and your businesses. Is that what you would surmise?",01:06:09,Sondland
1300,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s my understanding.,01:06:38,Sondland
1301,Section_3,Mike Conaway,And that his call for boycott gave rise to demonstrations in front of your hotels that made your customers have to weave in and out of the demonstrators to try to actually get into the hotels?,01:06:39,Sondland
1302,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"As I understand, they’re going on as we speak.",01:06:49,Sondland
1303,Section_3,Mike Conaway,"Well, the words are better put by a couple of other Oregonians. It says, “Congressman Blumenauer’s irresponsible attempt to hurt a homegrown business that supports hundreds of jobs in our local economy is just shameful and ought to be an outrage to all Oregonians.” Some fellow named McDermott. And then the lady named Ellen Carmichael, who I believe works for you, said, “We are saddened to have our Congressman, Earl Blumenauer, call for a boycott that would put the livelihoods of thousands of his constituents in peril. The attack on our employees is unwarranted.”",01:06:52,Sondland
1304,Section_3,Mike Conaway,"And I couldn’t agree more, Mr. Ambassador. Mr. Blumenauer should not be using the vast influences that we, as members of Congress, has to bully you and your businesses, and to harm the hundreds or thousands of employees that operate in your business by trying to take business away from you, to force you into doing something that they wanted you to do, which [inaudible 01:07:40] testify. And you actually have done that. But that’s a shame for that. And I’m hopeful that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join me in saying, Mr. Blumenauer, you really shouldn’t be using your congressional influence to try to bully and threaten a witness before these proceedings. That is just wrong. And I’m looking forward to my colleague’s response. And I yield back.",01:07:20,Sondland
1305,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Thank you, Congressman.",01:07:58,Sondland
1306,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Ms. Speier.,01:07:59,Sondland
1307,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"I was somewhat humored by your request that Mr. Blumenauer not bully to get something done when all we’re talking about is the president bullying to get something he wants done. But having said that, I’d like to clarify one point about the whistleblower protection from the article that Mr. Conaway just provided.",01:08:02,Sondland
1308,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"The law reads “… expressly restricts the Inspector General’s office from disclosing whistleblowers’ identities. It says, ‘The inspector general shall not disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee, unless the Inspector General determines that such a disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation, or the disclosure is made to an official of the Department of Justice responsible for determining whether a prosecution should be undertaken.’ That appears to be the lone statutory restriction on disclosing a whistleblower’s identity, applicable only to the Inspector General’s office. We found no court rulings on whether whistleblowers have a right to anonymity under the ICWPA, or related statutes. Vladeck said it is, nonetheless, a best practice to avoid disclosure of the Ukraine whistleblower’s identity given the concerns about retaliation. McCullough said, ‘We’ve stepped into bizarro land when senior policymakers are trying to yank a CIA employee into the public spotlight in retaliation for making a whistleblowing complaint, especially when they are credible threats to that employee’s personal safety.'”",01:08:23,Sondland
1309,Section_3,Jackie Speier,And I don’t know why our colleagues on the other side of the aisle-,01:09:46,Sondland
1310,Section_3,Mike Conaway,Does the [crosstalk 01:09:50] yield? [inaudible 01:09:51] lady yield?,01:09:50,Sondland
1311,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"No, I’m afraid I only have three minutes, and I have some other issues. But thank you.",01:09:51,Sondland
1312,Section_3,Mike Conaway,"Well, the end of the article does go through that. And it also says the three Pinocchios, in spite of that conversation.",01:09:54,Sondland
1313,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"The president of United States has five Pinocchios on a daily basis, so let’s not go there.",01:10:01,Sondland
1314,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"Ambassador Sondland, in your deposition, you lamented, “I was truly disappointed that the State Department prevented me, at the last minute, from testifying earlier on October 8th, 2019. But your issuance of a subpoena has supported my appearance here today, and I’m pleased to provide the following testimony.”",01:10:13,Sondland
1315,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"So it is clear that the White House, the State Department, did not want you to testify at that deposition. Is that correct?",01:10:35,Sondland
1316,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:10:43,Sondland
1317,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"And since then, you have on numerous occasions during your opening statement today indicated that you have not been able to access documents in the State Department. Is that correct?",01:10:44,Sondland
1318,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:10:56,Sondland
1319,Section_3,Jackie Speier,So you have been hampered in your ability to provide testimony to this committee. Is that correct?,01:10:57,Sondland
1320,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’ve been hampered to provide completely accurate testimony without the benefit of those documents.,01:11:02,Sondland
1321,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"In terms of your conversations with the president of the United States, what percentage of your conversations were about Ukraine, as compared to your other duties?",01:11:08,Sondland
1322,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall.,01:11:19,Sondland
1323,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"Well, and you’ve only had six conversations or seven conversations with the president, you said, so-",01:11:21,Sondland
1324,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"About Ukraine, I think.",01:11:27,Sondland
1325,Section_3,Jackie Speier,So you’ve had many other conversations?,01:11:29,Sondland
1326,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Oh yeah, about unrelated, completely unrelated matters.",01:11:31,Sondland
1327,Section_3,Jackie Speier,So how many conversations with the president of the United States have you had?,01:11:34,Sondland
1328,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I don’t want to give you a number because it’s going to be wrong if I don’t have the records.",01:11:36,Sondland
1329,Section_3,Jackie Speier,Is it less than 20?,01:11:40,Sondland
1330,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It’s probably in that range.,01:11:42,Sondland
1331,Section_3,Jackie Speier,All right. Would you say that delay in military aid and the lack of a meeting in the White House works to the benefit of Russia?,01:11:44,Sondland
1332,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Repeat the question again, please.",01:11:56,Sondland
1333,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"Would you say that the delay in military aid to Ukraine and the reluctance to have a White House meeting, has a benefit to Russia?",01:11:58,Sondland
1334,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think it could be looked that way, yes, looked at that way, yes.",01:12:08,Sondland
1335,Section_3,Jackie Speier,"All right. I’m going to just speak very briefly about code. When Michael Cohen was before the Oversight Committee, he was asked, “You suggest the president sometimes communicates his wishes indirectly. For example, you say, ‘Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates. It would be different, he said … He doesn’t give you questions, he doesn’t give you orders. He speaks in code. And I understand the code because I’ve been around him for a decade.'”",01:12:13,Sondland
1336,Section_3,Jackie Speier,So do you think that the president was speaking in code when he would talk about wanting investigations?,01:12:50,Sondland
1337,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t. I can’t characterize how the president was speaking. Every conversation I’ve had with the president has been fairly direct and straightforward.,01:12:58,Sondland
1338,Section_3,Jackie Speier,All right. I yield back.,01:13:07,Sondland
1339,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Stewart.,01:13:09,Sondland
1340,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"Mr. Chairman, I have a unanimous consent request.",01:13:10,Sondland
1341,Section_3,Adam Schiff,You may state your request.,01:13:14,Sondland
1342,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"The DOE responds to Ambassador Sondland’s comments before the House Intelligence Committee attributable to the DOE secretary of … the press secretary, “Ambassador Sondland’s testimony today misrepresented both Secretary Perry’s interaction with Rudy Giuliani and direction the secretary received from President Trump. As previously stated, Secretary Perry spoke to Rudy Giuliani only once at the president’s request. No one else was on that call. At no point before, during, or after the phone call, did the words ‘Biden’ or ‘Burisma’ ever come up in the presence of Secretary Perry.” Again, I ask that that be entered into the record.",01:13:15,Sondland
1343,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Without objection. Although, I would note that they’ve also refused to come and testify under oath.",01:13:56,Sondland
1344,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"The American people expect a lot of things out of politics, arguments, protests, we certainly see that, clash of principles and ideas, I think sometimes, eventually, they actually would like to see some compromise. But I think something they expect above everything else, fundamental, they expect that there is a sense of fairness about it. And I want to read part of a text I received from someone that I have tremendous respect for, just a few hours ago. She wrote, “Crafting a story to hurt another human being can never be right. The means of destroying and hurting another individual just does not justify the end. And politics does not give anyone a free pass to destroy other people.”",01:14:01,Sondland
1345,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"Now, you can say a lot about the treatment of President Trump over the last three years. But I think one thing you cannot argue is that it has been fair. There were those calling for his impeachment literally before he was inaugurated. For two and a half years, we were told every single day, “He has betrayed our country. He is a Russian asset. He has committed treason,” accusations that we know now are not true, and for which we never had any evidence to support that. He was accused of obstruction.",01:14:43,Sondland
1346,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"And now here we are actually impeaching the president over, well, first, quid pro quo, until we found out that didn’t pull very well with focus groups. And then it was bribery, until virtually every witness before us who was asked the question said they had no evidence of bribery. And now it’s extortion. And again, the American people expect some sense of fairness. So when Nancy Pelosi goes, before she has seen a shred of evidence, and she announces the president has betrayed his oath of office, he has betrayed the American people, he betrayed national security, without seeing any evidence, again, the American people say, “Well, what is fair about that?” So the question before us now is again extortion. That’s the latest version of the charges against the president. I’m not an attorney. Extortion sounds pretty scary. It’s kind of serious. I had to look it up, what it means. It means obtaining money or property by threat to a victim’s property or loved ones.",01:15:13,Sondland
1347,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"Mr. Ambassador, I’m going to read you a couple of quotes from president Zelensky and then ask you a question. First, from a Ukrainian press release, “Donald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve the image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption, which inhibited the interaction with Ukraine and the USA.” Does that sound like president Zelensky is being bribed or extorted in that comment?",01:16:10,Sondland
1348,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"As I testified previously, I’m not a lawyer either, and I don’t want to characterize-",01:16:35,Sondland
1349,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"Well, okay-",01:16:40,Sondland
1350,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,… any legal terms. I really don’t.,01:16:41,Sondland
1351,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"That’s fine. I think most people would read that and say, “That doesn’t sound like he’s under severe pressure.” He makes it very clear in his own words then. Ukrainian President Zelensky told reporters during a joint press conference with Donald Trump that he was not pressured by the US president. “Again, I was not pressured.” He used another time, “There was no blackmail.” I would ask you, do you think he felt like he was being extorted by the president, based on these comments?",01:16:43,Sondland
1352,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I really think that’s for the committee and the Congress to-,01:17:08,Sondland
1353,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"Well, you know what, Mr. Ambassador, it’s really for the American people.",01:17:11,Sondland
1354,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I agree.,01:17:15,Sondland
1355,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"And the American people aren’t stupid. And the American people can hear that and they can say, “I don’t think he was under duress. I don’t think he was being extorted. I don’t think there was an exchange of a bribe.” And I would conclude with this last observation, it is common for our national policy to withhold age for various reasons. You know that that’s true, as an ambassador. Is that not true?",01:17:16,Sondland
1356,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s true.,01:17:41,Sondland
1357,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"It’s frequent, isn’t it, that we will withhold aid for various reasons?",01:17:41,Sondland
1358,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:17:46,Sondland
1359,Section_3,Chris Stewart,"It is a policy. I mean, for example, President Bush did it. He suspended military aid to 35 countries over their lack of support for the International Criminal Court. I’ll bet that helped his political standing back home. But I don’t remember anyone suggesting we should impeach him for it. President Trump did it last year with Afghanistan over corruption. We did it with Pakistan over much the same thing. And no one suggested that we impeach them for it. This is a common occurrence in international relations. It is hardly an impeachable offense.",01:17:46,Sondland
1360,Section_3,Adam Schiff,The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Quigley.,01:18:19,Sondland
1361,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir, for being here today. There are things we can agree with our colleagues on, things we can disagree. I can agree with my colleague that we should turn over, all the documents should be turned over. Mr. Ambassador, I think you agree that it would have helped your testimony, helped you understood that the State Department, the White House hasn’t turned over a single document. The White House [inaudible 01:18:54] the president’s April phone conversation, but millions more out there. So on that, we can agree.",01:18:28,Sondland
1362,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"On others, we can disagree, as to, particularly as it relates to the whistleblower. It distresses me because I begin to wonder about the motivations. In the final analysis, the way I look at this is, if we were investigating an arson, you all would indict the person who pulled the fire alarm. That person’s job is done. And we’ve seen the smoke, and we’ve seen the fire. Whatever the whistleblower did, doesn’t change the president’s actions, doesn’t change the president’s own words, which are in our testimony, or in our our body of evidence. It doesn’t change Mr. Mulvaney’s own words. It doesn’t change the body of evidence here. All it does is put this person at risk.",01:19:01,Sondland
1363,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"Back to the documents and what you know, and clearly, Mr. Ambassador, you seem to have your memory jogged by documents. Let’s talk about May 23rd and see if this one helps you. Senator Johnson, in referencing the May 23rd meeting, in his letter, sir, says: “I have no recollection of the president saying that during the meeting. It is entirely possible he did, because I do not work for the president. If made, the comment [inaudible 01:20:28] did that register with me.” He also says: “I also remember Sondland staying behind to talk to the president as the rest of the delegation left the Oval Office.”",01:19:57,Sondland
1364,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"Sir, do you recall this later conversation, and what you and the president discussed?",01:20:39,Sondland
1365,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I do.,01:20:45,Sondland
1366,Section_3,Mike Quigley,And what was that?,01:20:46,Sondland
1367,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Just again, recapping what … It was sort of a free-for-all conversation, and I wanted to tie down exactly what we agreed to do and what we didn’t.",01:20:47,Sondland
1368,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"And in that subsequent … he reinforced, “Talk to Rudy,” and did he-",01:20:56,Sondland
1369,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,“Talk to Rudy. You guys should work on this.”,01:21:00,Sondland
1370,Section_3,Mike Quigley,Did he go into any more detail about what that meant?,01:21:02,Sondland
1371,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:21:04,Sondland
1372,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"Just said, “Talk to Rudy”?",01:21:05,Sondland
1373,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It was a very short conversation.,01:21:07,Sondland
1374,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"And the second part, you said there was something besides just, “Talk to Rudy”?",01:21:08,Sondland
1375,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah. To reconfirm that the three of us would be working on the Ukraine file, and so on.",01:21:12,Sondland
1376,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"Back to Rudy in this seemingly contradictory messages here, you now recall the prerequisite mentioned in the July 10th meeting, right, that when you were having this discussion, the first meeting in John Bolton’s office, sir-",01:21:21,Sondland
1377,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:21:38,Sondland
1378,Section_3,Mike Quigley,… that you referenced that there was a condition. Correct?,01:21:39,Sondland
1379,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I believe someone else testified that I raised that, and I didn’t dispute that testimony that I said, “It’s my understanding that in order to get this visit done, there needs to be an announcement about …” and I don’t know if I said “investigations,” or said, specifically, “Burisma and [crosstalk 00:20:00]-",01:21:43,Sondland
1380,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"Sure. But in your opening, you mentioned, at the very same time that, apparently, there was a meeting with Rudy Giuliani and the message you got was underscored, “Very concerned about what Lutsenko told them, that according to RG, Rudy Giuliani, the ZE-POTUS meeting will not happen,” which is not conditioned. It’s just not going to happen. Your understanding of the difference here?",01:22:00,Sondland
1381,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think what you’re saying is, this meeting I was talking about in my opening statement was apparently a meeting that Rudy Giuliani was having-",01:22:27,Sondland
1382,Section_3,Mike Quigley,At the same time.,01:22:37,Sondland
1383,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"… at the same time in Ukraine, unbeknownst to us.",01:22:38,Sondland
1384,Section_3,Mike Quigley,Right. But he’s saying something different. He’s saying it’s not going to happen. There’s no notice in here that it’s conditioned in any way.,01:22:41,Sondland
1385,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, that was Ambassador Volker’s point. This was really an exchange with Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Ambassador Volker is saying, “Don’t let other people speak for the US government.” That was his point.",01:22:48,Sondland
1386,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"But if Rudy is following the directions and he’s saying what he’s saying here, and you’re also following directions, right, and you’re saying it’s conditioned, who’s given you the instructions to say what you’re saying?",01:23:01,Sondland
1387,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s why we thought it was problematic to work with Mr. Giuliani.,01:23:12,Sondland
1388,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"Exactly. But who did you work with to say the things that you said? Did you have conversations with the Chief of Staff, with Secretary Pompeo, to say what you were saying? You didn’t [crosstalk 01:23:28]-",01:23:15,Sondland
1389,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Are you talking about in the July 10th meeting?,01:23:27,Sondland
1390,Section_3,Mike Quigley,That’s correct.,01:23:30,Sondland
1391,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Oh, yeah. With Ambassador Volker, because at that point, Ambassador Volker was the one in touch with Mr. Giuliani, not me.",01:23:31,Sondland
1392,Section_3,Mike Quigley,"But you had no direct conversations with Mr. Mulvaney about this, or Secretary Pompeo, to make this condition statement?",01:23:38,Sondland
1393,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Only the texts and emails that I’ve already reviewed.,01:23:44,Sondland
1394,Section_3,Mike Quigley,Thank you. My time is up.,01:23:49,Sondland
1395,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Ms. Stefanik.,01:23:56,Sondland
1396,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"Thank you, Ambassador Sondland, for your service. And I also want to thank you for your recognition in your opening statement of your hardworking staff at the US Mission to the EU. Mr Sondland, you testified that you never received any direct confirmation or specific information as to why there was a hold on aid.",01:23:57,Sondland
1397,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:24:15,Sondland
1398,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"And in fact, you testified, “President Trump never told me directly that the aid was conditioned on the investigations.”",01:24:16,Sondland
1399,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:24:24,Sondland
1400,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"You said, “Never heard those words from the president,” correct?",01:24:25,Sondland
1401,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:24:29,Sondland
1402,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"Instead, you testified that in your September 9th call with president Trump, the president said, “No quid pro quo. I want nothing. I want nothing. I want President Zelensky to do the right thing, do what he ran on.” Is that correct?",01:24:30,Sondland
1403,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:24:46,Sondland
1404,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,And the fact is the aid was given to Ukraine without any announcement of new investigations.,01:24:48,Sondland
1405,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:24:54,Sondland
1406,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"And President Trump did, in fact, meet with President Zelensky in September at the United Nations. Correct?",01:24:55,Sondland
1407,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He did.,01:25:01,Sondland
1408,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,And there was no announcement of investigations before this meeting?,01:25:02,Sondland
1409,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:25:05,Sondland
1410,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,And there was no announcement of investigations after this meeting?,01:25:06,Sondland
1411,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s right.,01:25:09,Sondland
1412,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"And you’ve been very clear when Chairman Schiff has asked you broadly about investigations, you’ve corrected that to say specifically your understanding of investigations are, investigation into the 2016 elections and investigations into Burisma. Is that correct?",01:25:10,Sondland
1413,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:25:25,Sondland
1414,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"And are you aware that during the Obama administration, the US partnered with the UK and Ukraine on an investigation into the owner of Burisma as part of Ukraine’s anti-corruption efforts?",01:25:26,Sondland
1415,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I became aware of it today during the hearing.,01:25:40,Sondland
1416,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"Other witnesses have testified, but yes. And in fact, the Obama administration’s State Department was concerned about the potential appearance of conflict of interest with Hunter Biden serving on the board of Burisma because they raised this as they were preparing Ambassador Yovanovitch for her Senate confirmation. Are you aware of that?",01:25:42,Sondland
1417,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’m not aware of it.,01:26:02,Sondland
1418,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"She testified when I asked her that question both in the open hearing and the closed deposition. And I’ve asked most of our witnesses this, and every witness I’ve asked has said yes, and I want to ask you this today. Do you believe that Hunter Biden having a position on the board of Burisma has the potential appearance of a conflict of interest?",01:26:03,Sondland
1419,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t want to characterize Hunter Biden’s service on the board one way or another. I just don’t know enough.,01:26:24,Sondland
1420,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"So you disagree with every other witness that has answered, “Yes, there is a potential appearance of a conflict of interest”?",01:26:29,Sondland
1421,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, you asked if there was a conflict or an appearance of [crosstalk 01:26:39]-",01:26:35,Sondland
1422,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,My quote was “the potential appearance of a conflict of interest.”,01:26:38,Sondland
1423,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I didn’t hear the word “appearance.” Well, clearly, it’s an appearance of a conflict.",01:26:42,Sondland
1424,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,"Correct. Clearly, it is an appearance of conflict of interest. Again, this is something that every witness has answered yes to, or agreed with. It could have a potential appearance. And yet, we are not allowed to call Hunter Biden to answer questions in front of this committee. Thank you again for your truthful testimony today. And I yield back.",01:26:45,Sondland
1425,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Thank you.,01:27:02,Sondland
1426,Section_3,Elise Stefanik,Mr. Swalwell.,01:27:06,Sondland
1427,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"Ambassador Sondland, you were told by the president and others to not show up. You showed up. I think that says a lot about you. And I think history will look kindly on you doing that. But there are consequences to that. And just a couple of hours ago, President Trump was asked about you, and he said, “I don’t know him well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well.” Is that true?",01:27:06,Sondland
1428,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"It really depends on what you mean by “know well.” We are not close friends, no. We have a professional, cordial working relationship.",01:27:37,Sondland
1429,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"And in that working relationship, he knows who you are?",01:27:44,Sondland
1430,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:27:47,Sondland
1431,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,And he has spoken to you often?,01:27:47,Sondland
1432,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,What’s often?,01:27:50,Sondland
1433,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"Well, you said at least 20 times.",01:27:51,Sondland
1434,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Okay. If that’s often, then it’s often.",01:27:53,Sondland
1435,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"And you donated a million dollars to his inaugural committee, is that right?",01:27:55,Sondland
1436,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I bought a V-VIP ticket to the inauguration.,01:28:03,Sondland
1437,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"That’s a lot of money, isn’t it?",01:28:08,Sondland
1438,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It’s a lot of money.,01:28:09,Sondland
1439,Section_3,Speaker 2,That’s an expensive ticket.,01:28:10,Sondland
1440,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"And after that, the president makes you ambassador to the European Union. Eventually, the ambassador to Ukraine is removed. And as you told us in your deposition, you become a central figure as it relates to Ukraine. That’s a pretty big responsibility, right?",01:28:11,Sondland
1441,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I don’t know that I said I was a central figure. I was one of several people who were tasked to work on the Ukraine file.",01:28:29,Sondland
1442,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"And would you ever, in that big responsibility, take any actions that were not authorized by President Trump?",01:28:36,Sondland
1443,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, by President Trump or the leadership in the State Department.",01:28:44,Sondland
1444,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,Were you ever hauled into the leadership of the State Department for any actions you had taken around your work on Ukraine?,01:28:49,Sondland
1445,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:28:56,Sondland
1446,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"As to Rudy Giuliani, on May 23rd, the president told you, “Talk to Rudy.” You talked to him a couple times. You, as you told us, in September, talked to the president a couple of times. Did the president ever say to you, “Stop talking to Rudy”?",01:28:58,Sondland
1447,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:29:12,Sondland
1448,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"Did he ever say, “Don’t any longer talk to Rudy”?",01:29:13,Sondland
1449,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:29:15,Sondland
1450,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"On Ukraine, you said that you were playing the hand, you were dealt. President Trump was the dealer, wasn’t he?",01:29:17,Sondland
1451,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,President Trump was what?,01:29:26,Sondland
1452,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"The dealer. In your metaphor, you were playing the hand you were dealt. The dealer is president Trump. Is that right?",01:29:27,Sondland
1453,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’ll re-characterize your question by saying we followed the direction of the president because that was the only pathway to working with Ukraine.,01:29:36,Sondland
1454,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"On page four of your testimony, you said, “Given what we know, given what we knew at the time, what we were asked to do, did not appear to be wrong.” And you would agree now, Ambassador, knowing what you know now, what you did not know at the time, there are some things around Ukraine that were wrong?",01:29:46,Sondland
1455,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I agree.,01:30:04,Sondland
1456,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,So let’s take out any leveraging of security assistance over the Ukrainians and a White House visit. Would you agree that it is wrong for the president of the United States to ask the leader of a foreign government to investigate the president of the United States’ political opponent?,01:30:05,Sondland
1457,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:30:24,Sondland
1458,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"Would you agree that, in addition to making that request for an investigation, leveraging a visit at the White House that a foreign government leader desperately needs, is also wrong?",01:30:25,Sondland
1459,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Leveraging in what respect?,01:30:36,Sondland
1460,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"A meeting at the White House. If someone really needs a meeting at the White House to show their legitimacy to their people, that leveraging that meeting and asking for an investigation would be wrong.",01:30:37,Sondland
1461,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, to be candid, Congressman, every meeting at the White House has conditions placed on it. I’ve never worked on a meeting at the White House that doesn’t have a host of conditions placed-",01:30:47,Sondland
1462,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"But if one of those conditions is to investigate a political opponent, you would agree that would be wrong?",01:30:55,Sondland
1463,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"The political opponent, yes. But making announcements or investigations per se, no.",01:30:59,Sondland
1464,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"And if you asked a foreign government leader to investigate your political opponent and leveraged a White House meeting, and leveraged security assistance, in this hypothetical, you would agree all three of those are wrong?",01:31:06,Sondland
1465,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"In the hypothetical, yes, I would agree.",01:31:17,Sondland
1466,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"Now, you, before becoming an ambassador, worked as a businessman. And I presume you worked on a lot of deals. Is that right?",01:31:19,Sondland
1467,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:31:25,Sondland
1468,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,Involving millions of dollars?,01:31:26,Sondland
1469,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:31:27,Sondland
1470,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,You work for a guy now who wrote a book called Art of the Deal. Is that right?,01:31:28,Sondland
1471,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I do.,01:31:32,Sondland
1472,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,And State Department employees have told us that they don’t want to make legal definitions around what occurred with the White House meeting being leveraged against the investigations. But you plainly call it a quid pro quo. Is that right?,01:31:33,Sondland
1473,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I did.,01:31:46,Sondland
1474,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,"And finally, one final hypothetical, if someone walks through those two doors wearing rain boots, a rain coat, and holding an umbrella with raindrops falling off of them, do you have to see outside that it’s raining, to presume or conclude that it might be raining outside?",01:31:47,Sondland
1475,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I understand your hypothetical.,01:32:09,Sondland
1476,Section_3,Eric Swalwell,I yield back.,01:32:11,Sondland
1477,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Thank you.,01:32:12,Sondland
1478,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Hurd.,01:32:14,Sondland
1479,Section_3,Will Hurd,"Thank you. Mr. Ambassador, good to see you.",01:32:19,Sondland
1480,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Good to see you.,01:32:21,Sondland
1481,Section_3,Will Hurd,My colleague from California basically implied that you’ve been supported of president Trump’s campaign. Is that correct?,01:32:24,Sondland
1482,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I’m having a very hard time hearing you, sir.",01:32:30,Sondland
1483,Section_3,Will Hurd,My colleague from California indicated that you were supportive of the president’s campaign. Is that correct?,01:32:33,Sondland
1484,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I actually donated to the inaugural committee in order to secure tickets.,01:32:39,Sondland
1485,Section_3,Will Hurd,"So let me ask this question. Did you participate in or overhear any conversations about the potential information collected by Ukrainians on the Bidens, would be used for political gain?",01:32:47,Sondland
1486,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Did I-,01:33:03,Sondland
1487,Section_3,PART 3 OF 5 ENDS [,],01:33:04,Sondland
1488,Section_3,Will Hurd,… On the Bidens would be used for political gain?,01:33:00,Sondland
1489,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Did I personally hear that? No.,01:33:03,Sondland
1490,Section_3,Will Hurd,Did you participate in any conversations when this was being discussed?,01:33:05,Sondland
1491,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Not that I recall.,01:33:08,Sondland
1492,Section_3,Will Hurd,"In your statement on page five you said, “Mr. Giuliani’s request were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Selensky.” Then you also recounted your conversation with President Trump where he says, “I want nothing. No quid pro quo.” How do you reconcile these two statements?",01:33:10,Sondland
1493,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"They’re hard to reconcile. We were working along Mr. Giuliani’s direction for a period of time. We still didn’t have a White House meeting, aid was now held up. There were lots of reasons being given by various people as to why those weren’t moving forward and I finally got exasperated by receiving Ambassador Taylor’s latest text and I just picked up the phone. I got through to the president and I said, what do you want?",01:33:33,Sondland
1494,Section_3,Will Hurd,"Sure. Are you aware of any specific conversations Mayor Giuliani had with the president between your May 23rd conversation and September, 11, 2019?",01:34:04,Sondland
1495,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t recall if Mayor Giuliani, when I was directly talking to him either through a conference call or on a direct call, whether he quoted from the president or said I just talked to the president. Most of the communications, as I said, went through Ambassador Volker initially. So I don’t want to opine on what may or may not have been said.",01:34:19,Sondland
1496,Section_3,Will Hurd,"On page 11 of your testimony, you said “Mr. Giuliani had been communicating with Ukrainians without our knowledge.” I’m assuming you’re believing you, Mr. Volker and Ambassador Taylor. Which Ukrainians was Rudy Giuliani communicating with?",01:34:42,Sondland
1497,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I was specifically referring to this text that I received from Ambassador Volker where Mr. Giuliani was apparently telling the Ukrainians something that frustrated Ambassador Volker.",01:34:59,Sondland
1498,Section_3,Will Hurd,Sure. So who specifically? We know that …,01:35:13,Sondland
1499,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Mr. Lutsenko, the old prosecutor.",01:35:16,Sondland
1500,Section_3,Will Hurd,And do you think Mr. Lutsenko has any groggy tasks within this Selensky regime?,01:35:18,Sondland
1501,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know. He was the old attorney general.,01:35:25,Sondland
1502,Section_3,Will Hurd,And ultimately got fired in August when the new …,01:35:27,Sondland
1503,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I think so. Yeah.,01:35:31,Sondland
1504,Section_3,Will Hurd,… Group came in. Okay. So we know Rudy Giuliani has met with Mr. Yurmach on the fringes of meetings and I think it was Spain. Do you know any other Ukrainian official within this Selensky regime that Mayor Giuliani was meeting with?,01:35:32,Sondland
1505,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know who Mr. Giuliani was meeting with.,01:35:47,Sondland
1506,Section_3,Will Hurd,"Had you had any conversations with Ukrainian officials within the Selensky regime that came to you and said, hey, I just got off the phone with Giuliani. What the hell is he talking about?",01:35:50,Sondland
1507,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall.,01:36:02,Sondland
1508,Section_3,Will Hurd,"Would that be normal? In all your interactions with ambassadors and heads of states and governments, if there is some element of the US Government that they have spoken to, isn’t it usually the step that they come in, talk to the ambassador to try to clarify what that statement was? Is that a true characterization of how elements of diplomacy work?",01:36:04,Sondland
1509,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I think that’s a reasonable possibility. Things work all kinds of different ways these days.,01:36:24,Sondland
1510,Section_3,Will Hurd,"When you met with President Selensky after the July 25th phone call, so you met him on July 26, did the investigations or Joe Biden come up in that meeting?",01:36:30,Sondland
1511,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall Joe Biden coming up.,01:36:41,Sondland
1512,Section_3,Will Hurd,Was there any frustration expressed to you by the phone call that happened the day before?,01:36:43,Sondland
1513,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No. As I testified, everyone said it was a good call.",01:36:47,Sondland
1514,Section_3,Will Hurd,"Is in your opinion, your interactions with President Selensky, is he a straight shooter? Is he a liar or is he a liar?",01:36:51,Sondland
1515,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He impressed me greatly and that’s why I wanted to get he and President Trump together as soon as possible.,01:36:58,Sondland
1516,Section_3,Will Hurd,And so when he makes express statements you tend to believe them?,01:37:03,Sondland
1517,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Yeah. With my limited interaction with him, he seems very honorable.",01:37:07,Sondland
1518,Section_3,Will Hurd,"Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. I hope you make your plane.",01:37:11,Sondland
1519,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Thank you Mr. Hurd.,01:37:13,Sondland
1520,Section_3,Will Hurd,I yield back.,01:37:14,Sondland
1521,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Castro.,01:37:17,Sondland
1522,Section_3,Rep. Castro,"Thank you, Chairman. Good afternoon, Ambassador. Welcome. Others close to President Trump have made it clear that investigations were in fact part of the conditions for US assistance to Ukraine, including Rudy Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff. So a Mr. Sondland at a press conference on October 17th, acting White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney discussed his belief that it’s entirely appropriate to politicize US foreign policy. Ambassador, how often did you speak or meet with Mr. Mulvaney?",01:37:18,Sondland
1523,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, based on my lack of of records, I’m going by a bad memory.",01:37:52,Sondland
1524,Section_3,Rep. Castro,Just based on your memory.,01:37:58,Sondland
1525,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I only think I had one formal meeting with Mr. Mulvaney and it had nothing to do with Ukraine. It had to do with a completely unrelated matter.,01:37:59,Sondland
1526,Section_3,Rep. Castro,So did you have a chance to talk with Mr. Mulvaney about your efforts in the Ukraine?,01:38:07,Sondland
1527,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I think most of our communication were through the stream of emails, which others were on generally, and I may have seen him at the White House casually and said hello and kept in touch. But we didn’t have a back and forth.",01:38:11,Sondland
1528,Section_3,Rep. Castro,"Well, let me ask you this. Was it your sense of Mr. Mulvaney had a direct line to President Trump? He must have as acting chief of staff, is that right?",01:38:27,Sondland
1529,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Of course.,01:38:35,Sondland
1530,Section_3,Rep. Castro,Let us look at what Mr. Mulvaney said during his October 17th press conference.,01:38:36,Sondland
1531,Section_3,Mick Mulvaney,Those were the driving factors. Did he also mentioned to me in past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money. Now there was a report …,01:38:46,Sondland
1532,Section_3,Speaker 3,So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he was going to withhold funding to Ukraine?,01:39:01,Sondland
1533,Section_3,Mick Mulvaney,"The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation, and that is absolutely appropriate.",01:39:08,Sondland
1534,Section_3,Rep. Castro,He said that President Trump in that clip had an interest in the investigations. Did he not?,01:39:20,Sondland
1535,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Apparently. Yes.,01:39:29,Sondland
1536,Section_3,Rep. Castro,He’s the chief of staff. He’s somebody that sees the president and has conversation with the president every single day. Wouldn’t you expect that?,01:39:30,Sondland
1537,Section_3,Speaker 4,It’s described as a quid pro quo.,01:39:37,Sondland
1538,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I would expect he has a direct line to the president.,01:39:40,Sondland
1539,Section_3,Rep. Castro,"Ambassador Sondland, when did you first learn from Mr. Mulvaney that the investigations were holding up the security assistance? If at any time?",01:39:43,Sondland
1540,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know that I heard it from Mr. Mulvaney.,01:39:50,Sondland
1541,Section_3,Rep. Castro,"Okay. Ambassador Sondland, I know that you’re not a career foreign service officer. Is it your understanding that the US Government conditions security assistance on an investigation into a political rival all the time?",01:39:53,Sondland
1542,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’ve already testified I didn’t think that would be proper.,01:40:11,Sondland
1543,Section_3,Rep. Castro,All right. Well let us also see what Mr. Mulvaney had to say about that at the same press conference.,01:40:15,Sondland
1544,Section_3,Mick Mulvaney,Those were the driving factors. Did he also mention to me in past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. That’s why we held up the money. Now there was a report.,01:40:35,Sondland
1545,Section_3,Rep. Castro,I’ll just go ahead and read it for you because this thing. I’ll read it. He says that I have news for everybody. Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy. Knowing what you know now about what was intended with Ukraine. Do you agree with Mr. Mulvaney that there’s just going to be political influence and foreign policy or that we should all just get over it and allow a president now or later to investigate a political rival and ask a foreign government to do that? Do you agree with Mr. Mulvaney?,01:40:49,Sondland
1546,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I think there’s a big difference between political influence and investigating a rival because politics enters into everything relating to foreign policy.,01:41:25,Sondland
1547,Section_3,Rep. Castro,But you disagree that the president … You agree that the president should not be allowed to ask for the investigation of a political rival.,01:41:33,Sondland
1548,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"In the context of what was going on in Ukraine, I believe that the president should not investigate a political arrival in return for a quid pro quo.",01:41:43,Sondland
1549,Section_3,Rep. Castro,"And part of the way that you figured that all of this stuff that was going on, that you were part of something that was basically wrong is because in the July 25th phone call, the president himself, he didn’t tell you, we don’t know if he told Rudy Giuliani or not because Rudy Giuliani won’t come in here. He said directly to the president of Ukraine that he wanted the Bidens investigated. Wasn’t that your reading of the call?",01:41:53,Sondland
1550,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"First of all, I don’t believe that I was a part of something that was wrong because based on what I knew, I thought we were operating well within the center lane of proper US diplomacy.",01:42:19,Sondland
1551,Section_3,Rep. Castro,I yield back.,01:42:30,Sondland
1552,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Ratcliffe.,01:42:32,Sondland
1553,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"Chairman, thank you. Ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a statement issued this morning from the Office of the Vice President by Chief of Staff, Mark Short.",01:42:34,Sondland
1554,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Without objection.,01:42:43,Sondland
1555,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"Ambassador Sondland, I’ll be brief. In anticipation of Mr. Holmes’ testimony tomorrow about this July 26 phone call that he overheard at a cafe in Kiev that you had with President Trump. He overheard that even though the call was not on speaker phone, correct?",01:42:46,Sondland
1556,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t believe so.,01:43:10,Sondland
1557,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,Was it an open air cafe?,01:43:12,Sondland
1558,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It was outdoors.,01:43:14,Sondland
1559,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"One of the points that my Democratic colleagues keep making is that David Holmes’ prior testimony, which he’ll apparently confirm tomorrow is that President Trump said that he doesn’t give a blank about Ukraine. You heard that earlier?",01:43:17,Sondland
1560,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That was not on the phone call. I don’t think he testified that was on the phone call. I think he was testifying that I summarized the phone call and I don’t recall saying that.,01:43:35,Sondland
1561,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,And you have no recollection of that?,01:43:45,Sondland
1562,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t, yeah.",01:43:47,Sondland
1563,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"Even if it was true, there’s nothing wrong with that to have an opinion about.",01:43:50,Sondland
1564,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He can have whatever opinion he wants about Ukraine.,01:43:54,Sondland
1565,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"It’s all part of the narrative that President Trump is a bad guy, that he doesn’t care about the Ukrainians, but it seems to me, Ambassador Sondland, that nothing says you care more about the Ukrainians than sending javelin anti-tank missiles. Do you agree with me?",01:43:56,Sondland
1566,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I agree that sending javelin anti-tank missiles is something that Ukraine wanted and needed.,01:44:12,Sondland
1567,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,"Certainly, those work a lot better at stopping Russian tanks than the blankets that were sent by the Obama Administration.",01:44:17,Sondland
1568,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Your point is taken.,01:44:24,Sondland
1569,Section_3,John Ratcliffe,I’ll yield back.,01:44:26,Sondland
1570,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Thank you.,01:44:27,Sondland
1571,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Heck.,01:44:30,Sondland
1572,Section_3,Rep. Heck,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ambassador, thank you for your stamina, sir. Have a few quick fairly easy questions. You would agree, would you not sir, that foreign interference in our elections is or can be a threat to our democracy?",01:44:31,Sondland
1573,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Under certain conditions, yes.",01:44:45,Sondland
1574,Section_3,Rep. Heck,There are conditions under which their interference is not a threat?,01:44:48,Sondland
1575,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’m sorry. Did you say foreign interference?,01:44:51,Sondland
1576,Section_3,Rep. Heck,Yes.,01:44:53,Sondland
1577,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Always, sorry.",01:44:54,Sondland
1578,Section_3,Rep. Heck,And do you also agree that identifying and preventing that interference should be a priority of the federal government?,01:44:55,Sondland
1579,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,It should be one of its priorities.,01:45:00,Sondland
1580,Section_3,Rep. Heck,"And when were assisting President Trump in his effort to obtain those investigations, did you at all realize that those investigations could in fact impact the 2020 election?",01:45:02,Sondland
1581,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:45:13,Sondland
1582,Section_3,Rep. Heck,"Do you believe, sir, that it is ever appropriate to invite, press, bribe or coheres foreign interference in our elections?",01:45:14,Sondland
1583,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No.,01:45:26,Sondland
1584,Section_3,Rep. Heck,"Thank you. I want to refer to something that you said in your opening statement. As I previously testified, had I known of all of Mr. Giuliani’s dealings or of his associations with individuals now under criminal indictment, I would not have acquiesced to his participation. It’s hard to read that without believing that you thought that what he was doing was either wrong or that he was not reputable. Fair?",01:45:28,Sondland
1585,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Well with 20/20 hindsight that’s fair.,01:45:55,Sondland
1586,Section_3,Rep. Heck,"Yes. You’ve testified here today that you also came to believe that the requests for investigations into Burisma was in fact a request to investigate the Bidens, both former vice president and Hunter and indeed the transcript of the July 25th call makes specific reference to that including Hunter Biden and today even the ranking members said we could clear all this up if we could have Hunter Biden and I have a simple question. What Ukrainian law did Hunter Biden violate?",01:45:58,Sondland
1587,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’m not aware.,01:46:31,Sondland
1588,Section_3,Rep. Heck,What evidence is there that he may have violated any Ukrainian law.,01:46:33,Sondland
1589,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I’m not aware.,01:46:37,Sondland
1590,Section_3,Rep. Heck,"That’s because there is none, sir. Finally, also from your opening statement, you said, as you know, I have already provided 10 hours of deposition testimony. I did so despite directives from the White House and the State Department that I refuse to appear as many others have done. I agreed to testify because I respect the gravity of the moment and I believe I have an obligation to account fully for my role in these events. Did by obligation you mean simply your legal obligation or did you mean something bigger?",01:46:38,Sondland
1591,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, both my legal obligation and my moral obligation.",01:47:17,Sondland
1592,Section_3,Rep. Heck,"Your moral obligation. I actually want to present an alternative theory. Your family came here escaping the Holocaust via Uruguay and your parents moved Lucy and later you here where frankly you’ve been an American success story. Through dent of hard work and innovation, good idea, a knack to hire the right people and some luck, you’ve built a considerable successful business. One that I know for a fact would make your parents proud. They came here because they knew that it was here that they could have freedom that they had not enjoyed, security that they had not enjoyed, and opportunity that they had not enjoyed.",01:47:19,Sondland
1593,Section_3,Rep. Heck,And no doubt on some level you’re grateful and it’s created a sense of patriotism in you. Is that fair to say?,01:48:14,Sondland
1594,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Very fair.,01:48:24,Sondland
1595,Section_3,Rep. Heck,"Why then, sir, with your courage to come before us, does that same standard not apply to Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Duffy, Mr. Polmpeo, Mr. Bolton, Mr. Vote, Mr. Giuliani? Why shouldn’t those same sentiments beat within their hearts to do their patriotic duty and do what you have done, sir? Indeed, why doesn’t that same standard apply to the President of the United States?",01:48:26,Sondland
1596,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I wish I could answer.,01:48:56,Sondland
1597,Section_3,Rep. Heck,"I suspect you can’t because there is no good answer. But I do appreciate your willingness to come here today. With that, I yield back, Mr chairman.",01:48:59,Sondland
1598,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Thank you, Congressman.",01:49:07,Sondland
1599,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Jordan.,01:49:09,Sondland
1600,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I asked unanimous consent to enter into the record a statement from Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney.",01:49:10,Sondland
1601,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Without objection. We haven’t seen all these statements, but I presume they are accurate and no objection.",01:49:18,Sondland
1602,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"Thank you. Ambassador, President Trump’s not a big fan of foreign aid, is that right?",01:49:23,Sondland
1603,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t know if that’s a fair characterization. I think he’s careful.,01:49:29,Sondland
1604,Section_3,Jim Jordan,He’s expressed concerns about foreign aid going to certain countries.,01:49:32,Sondland
1605,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yeah.,01:49:34,Sondland
1606,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"Okay, fair enough. And he knew Ukraine was corrupt, is that right?",01:49:34,Sondland
1607,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He believed Ukraine was corrupt.,01:49:38,Sondland
1608,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"Yeah, and he wanted Europe to do more?",01:49:39,Sondland
1609,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Definitely.,01:49:41,Sondland
1610,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"Definitely wanted Europe to do more. And the president had a belief that Ukrainian government officials, some senior Ukrainian government officials supported his opponent in 2016. I won’t go into all the details, but I think of the one member of parliament who said that majority of Ukrainian politicians want Hillary Clinton to win. So he had that belief as well, and obviously he understood what was happening. We’ve got a brand new guy in Ukraine. This Selensky guy wins, right?",01:49:42,Sondland
1611,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Right.,01:50:08,Sondland
1612,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"And his party takes over and President Trump wants to see with all these other things that are concerned him, he wants to see if this new guy’s actually, as I like to say, the real deal, a real reformer and actually going to deal with the corruption problem. So aid gets held up for 55 days, gets held up on June 18th or excuse me, July 18th and then is released on September 11th. But it seems to me more important than the 55 day pause is the 14 days when Ukraine realized aid was held up on the 29th. We’ve now had you testify to that. The two witnesses yesterday testified that, the political article.",01:50:08,Sondland
1613,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"So aid gets held up on August, excuse me, Ukraine leans aid is held on August 29th and then of course released on September 11th. In those 14 days, there are three important meetings with senior government officials and President Selensky. There’s the August 29th meeting between Ambassador Bolton and Presidents Selensky. There’s the meeting September 1st that you’re a part of, Vice President Pence meets with President Selensky and then there’s a meeting on September 5th where US Senators Murphy and Johnson meet with President Selensky.",01:50:45,Sondland
1614,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"None of those meetings, none of those meanings did any linkage to security assistance dollars and an announcement or start of any investigation ever come up. None of them, but it seems to me the one that’s the most important is probably the one we’ve talked least about and that’s the September 5th meeting. Because that’s actually a meeting where there is no one, well, it’s much more congressional-focused than White House-focused. This is the meeting where Senators Murphy and Johnson bipartisan meet with president Selensky and what’s interesting is what both senators in the last two days have given us letters recounting what happened in that meeting. Senator Murphy said, “I broached the topic of pressure on Selensky from Rudy Giuliani and the president’s other emissaries to launch investigations of Trump’s political rival.” Murphy brought it up. You got two senators who both strong supporters of money going to Ukraine, these guys are all for it and Senator Murphy, the Democrat, even brings up the issue everyone’s been talking about. It seems to me if ever there was going to be a time where the President of Ukraine says, guys, you don’t know what I’m dealing with. I’m getting pressure from the President of the United States.",01:51:17,Sondland
1615,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"He wants me to do this. I got to make it. It seems if ever there was a time that the President of Ukraine, the new guy who now knows the aid has been on on hold, if ever there was a time to bring it up, that would have been the time, but guess what? At no time, Senator Johnson tells us, at no time during this meeting or on any other meeting on this trip was there any mention by Selensky or any other Ukrainian that they were feeling pressure to do anything in return for military aid. Not even, Senator Johnson says, not even after Murphy warned them about getting involved in the election.",01:52:36,Sondland
1616,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"So Murphy gave this big deal on Giuliani and nothing. Nothing. And guess what Murphy also said. “I do not dispute any of Senator Johnson’s factual representations regarding the meeting.” If ever it was going to happen, September 5th was a day. No one from the White House there, not Ambassador Bolton, not vice president, no one there. But even that it didn’t happen. And we got all kinds of other meetings when it didn’t happen. And of course, as you testified earlier, there was never an announcement. You said there were three quid pro quos, but there weren’t because there was never an announcement.",01:53:17,Sondland
1617,Section_3,Jim Jordan,"I mean this is as clear as it gets, but these guys want to keep stirring it up based on no direct evidence whatsoever. And the best direct evidence we have is actually what the president told you. I want nothing. There is no quid pro quo. I want Selensky to do exactly what he campaigned on and when that became clear to us, guess what? They got the money. They got the money. God bless America. It all worked out. Right? This is crazy what we’re going through because the facts are so darn clear. I yield back.",01:53:53,Sondland
1618,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Welch.,01:54:29,Sondland
1619,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador, I’m impressed with your career and very successful in business. I’m impressed with your commitment to public service and I was very impressed with your forthright statement, so thank you for that. You said it was the highest honor for you to have this opportunity to have this appointment to serve as ambassador to the EU. Correct?",01:54:30,Sondland
1620,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:54:55,Sondland
1621,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"And you quickly became very involved in the Ukraine policy. And that policy has been described by you and others was really very clear, help Ukraine fight internal corruption and resist external aggression. Correct?",01:54:56,Sondland
1622,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:55:11,Sondland
1623,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"And this Congress, I think with the support of everybody up here, Republicans and Democrats, and in fact with a significant amount of Republican leadership authorized the release of military aid. Right?",01:55:12,Sondland
1624,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Right.,01:55:26,Sondland
1625,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"And you and others who are working with you believed it was very important to the new government, President Selensky, to have that white house meeting to show our support and send a signal to Russia. Correct?",01:55:27,Sondland
1626,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,01:55:40,Sondland
1627,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"And from hearing you and from hearing our other witnesses, Ambassador Yovanovitch, Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Taylor, there was a concerted team effort on your part to get that meeting and release that aid. Correct?",01:55:41,Sondland
1628,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, there was always a concerted effort on my part to get the meeting. That was my singular narrow focus was to get the meeting.",01:55:58,Sondland
1629,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"Right. And that was shared by all of the colleagues I just mentioned, correct?",01:56:06,Sondland
1630,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:56:11,Sondland
1631,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"All right. And incredibly urgent, Ambassador Taylor described going to the front where Ukrainians who were dying at the Donbass. 14,000 had died, and it was an existential issue for them that they get the aid. And you were well aware of that and shared, I’m sure Ambassador Taylor’s concern. Is that correct?",01:56:12,Sondland
1632,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I did.,01:56:35,Sondland
1633,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"Right. And in your forthright testimony, you’ve testified, and it’s really with the benefit of hindsight because you couldn’t piece it all together, Giuliani knew in real time what you were trying to figure out as you went along. Is that a fair statement?",01:56:36,Sondland
1634,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I think so.,01:56:52,Sondland
1635,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"When you testified that you acted on the orders of the president, that was you acting on his orders, correct?",01:56:53,Sondland
1636,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:56:59,Sondland
1637,Section_3,Rep. Welch,And you said quite explicitly there was a quid pro quo.,01:57:00,Sondland
1638,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Relating to the meeting and the Burisma DNC.,01:57:05,Sondland
1639,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"That’s exactly right. No meeting, no meeting unless there is an investigation. Right?",01:57:09,Sondland
1640,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s what we were told by Mr. Giuliani.,01:57:16,Sondland
1641,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"All right. And Mr. Giuliani, you absolute …",01:57:18,Sondland
1642,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Wait, no meeting unless there was an announcement of an investigation.",01:57:20,Sondland
1643,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"Okay. Thank you. And I asked … By the way, did the efforts of Mr. Giuliani authorized by the president impede the efforts that you and others were making to try to advance what you thought was that Ukraine policy?",01:57:23,Sondland
1644,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Not initially. We were just working …,01:57:41,Sondland
1645,Section_3,Rep. Welch,Ultimately?,01:57:43,Sondland
1646,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Well ultimately nothing happened.,01:57:44,Sondland
1647,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"Right. And Giuliani was the one who was absolutely insistent on the meeting, correct?",01:57:46,Sondland
1648,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Giuliani was insistent on the …,01:57:51,Sondland
1649,Section_3,Rep. Welch,The investigation.,01:57:53,Sondland
1650,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,… Investigation.,01:57:54,Sondland
1651,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"All right. Now I asked this of Ambassador Taylor or Ambassador Volker, if the mayor of Portland said to the police chief, I’m not going to authorize your budget unless you agree to do an investigation into my political opponent. Would that be wrong?",01:57:55,Sondland
1652,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Of course.,01:58:18,Sondland
1653,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"And likewise, if it were the governor of the state of Oregon doing the same thing, correct?",01:58:18,Sondland
1654,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,01:58:24,Sondland
1655,Section_3,Rep. Welch,And would that same rule apply to the President of the United States?,01:58:25,Sondland
1656,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,To investigate a political opponent? Yes.,01:58:31,Sondland
1657,Section_3,Rep. Welch,That’s correct.,01:58:33,Sondland
1658,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,01:58:33,Sondland
1659,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"All right. So that’s the question here. The president, in his phone call, he asked President Selensky who desperately needed the release of that aid, who desperately needed the White House meeting to do an investigation, and it was focused on the Bidens and Hunter Biden and Burisma and CrowdStrike. You don’t have to answer that. The president’s words speak for themselves. Do you feel as a person who went into public service to serve, who had a team of people to share your desire to help Ukraine, do you feel in any way betrayed by the double dealing of the president?",01:58:34,Sondland
1660,Section_3,Rep. Welch,It’s a real question.,01:59:17,Sondland
1661,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t want to characterize …,01:59:20,Sondland
1662,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"You don’t have to characterize him. I’m just, we all, if we get a chance to do something useful, we’d like to do it and there’s no better joy than when you’re doing it with other people.",01:59:22,Sondland
1663,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Mr. Welch, let me answer your question this way. I would have preferred that and I’m sure everyone would have preferred that the president simply met with Mr. Selensky right away. Our assessment of Mr. Selensky was that he and the president would get on famously. He was smart, he was funny, he was charming, he was the kind of person the president would like. And once the two of them got together, we thought the chemistry would take over and good things would happen between the US and Ukraine relationship. That’s why we were pushing for a quick unconditional meeting.",01:59:31,Sondland
1664,Section_3,Rep. Welch,So it’s unfortunate that he was …,02:00:04,Sondland
1665,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That it didn’t happen.,02:00:05,Sondland
1666,Section_3,Rep. Welch,"… Unwilling to meet without the commitment on the investigation. Thank you, Ambassador.",02:00:06,Sondland
1667,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Thank you.,02:00:10,Sondland
1668,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr Maloney.,02:00:11,Sondland
1669,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"Mr. Ambassador, let’s pick up right there. You would have preferred a if they just had the meeting with the President of Ukraine without these conditions. Is that what you’re saying?",02:00:12,Sondland
1670,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,02:00:22,Sondland
1671,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,But there were these conditions and it involved an investigation. Right? You’ve said that many times.,02:00:24,Sondland
1672,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Well remember the initial invitation that the president sent to President Selensky had no conditions.,02:00:29,Sondland
1673,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"But, that didn’t last very long. Did it? And then there were conditions. This is not controversial at this point, I don’t believe, sir. There were conditions that president wanted investigations. Right?",02:00:36,Sondland
1674,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Right.,02:00:44,Sondland
1675,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,And you thought they were Burisma and the 2016 election?,02:00:45,Sondland
1676,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,02:00:48,Sondland
1677,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"We now know, of course that Burisma means Bidens. Right?",02:00:48,Sondland
1678,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Today we do.,02:00:52,Sondland
1679,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"And we can probably from today until the end of time set aside any confusion that when somebody is asking for an investigation of Burisma over the summer, what they really meant was Bidens, right?",02:00:53,Sondland
1680,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,With 20/20 hindsight. Yes.,02:01:04,Sondland
1681,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"Right. With hindsight. And of course on the day after the president’s famous call, you’re having lunch with David Holmes, we’ve covered this and he overhears your conversation. And I said, I know you said you have no reason to dispute what Mr. Holmes said. And I think you said you wouldn’t have any reason to think he didn’t speak about investigations with the president. The president raised investigations with you, right?",02:01:06,Sondland
1682,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,02:01:29,Sondland
1683,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,On the 26th?,02:01:30,Sondland
1684,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,02:01:31,Sondland
1685,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"And we now know, of course, that was about the Bidens and Burisma and 2016 right? I mean, I know you didn’t know that at the time, that’s your testimony, but we …",02:01:31,Sondland
1686,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I understood it meant to mean Burisma.,02:01:40,Sondland
1687,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"Mr. Holmes says, you said Biden’s right after that, but I know you don’t recall that, right?",02:01:41,Sondland
1688,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,02:01:45,Sondland
1689,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,Do you dispute it?,02:01:46,Sondland
1690,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I do.,02:01:48,Sondland
1691,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"Okay. But you don’t recall it, but we know that’s what the president meant. Right? And you do confirm that he wanted to talk about investigations with you?",02:01:49,Sondland
1692,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well now with the complete picure, what he said 24 hours before. Yes, it makes sense.",02:01:56,Sondland
1693,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"I understand. And you said it’s wrong to investigate political opponents. We’ve agreed on that today, haven’t we, sir?",02:02:01,Sondland
1694,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yes.,02:02:07,Sondland
1695,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,And yet of course that’s what we know the president was asking for. Let me ask you something. Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president’s political opponents?,02:02:08,Sondland
1696,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t want to characterize who would have and who would not have.,02:02:20,Sondland
1697,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"I know you don’t want to, sir. That’s my question. Would you answer it for me?",02:02:23,Sondland
1698,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Restate your question.,02:02:27,Sondland
1699,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,Who would benefit from an investigation of the president’s political opponent?,02:02:28,Sondland
1700,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, presumably the person who asked for the investigation.",02:02:34,Sondland
1701,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,Who was that?,02:02:38,Sondland
1702,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"If the president for the investigation, it would be he.",02:02:40,Sondland
1703,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"Well, it’s not a hypothetical, is it, sir? We just went around this track, didn’t we? The president asked you about investigations. He was talking about the Bidens. When he asked you about the Biden investigation, who was he seeking to benefit?",02:02:42,Sondland
1704,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He did not ask me about the Biden investigation …,02:02:57,Sondland
1705,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,When he asked you about investigations.,02:03:00,Sondland
1706,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I said that about 19 times, Mr. Maloney.",02:03:00,Sondland
1707,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"Sir, we just went through this. When he asked you about investigations, which we all agree now means the Bidens. We just did this about 30 seconds ago. Right? It’s a pretty simple question, isn’t it? I guess I’m having trouble why you can’t just say …",02:03:02,Sondland
1708,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"When he asked about investigations, I assumed he meant …",02:03:17,Sondland
1709,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,I know what you assumed.,02:03:20,Sondland
1710,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,… Company.,02:03:21,Sondland
1711,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,But who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens?,02:03:21,Sondland
1712,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,There are two different questions.,02:03:26,Sondland
1713,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,I’m just asking you one. Who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens?,02:03:27,Sondland
1714,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I assume President Trump would benefit.,02:03:31,Sondland
1715,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"There we have it, see. Didn’t hurt a bit, did it? Didn’t hurt a bit. But let me ask you something …",02:03:33,Sondland
1716,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Mr. Maloney.,02:03:43,Sondland
1717,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"Hold on, sir.",02:03:44,Sondland
1718,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Excuse me. I’ve been very forthright and I really resent what you’re trying to do.,02:03:45,Sondland
1719,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"Fair enough. You’ve been very forthright. This is your third try to do so, sir. Didn’t work so well the first time. Did it? We had a little declaration come in after you remember that. And now we’re here third time or we got a doozy of a statement from you this morning. There’s a whole bunch of stuff you don’t recall. So all due respect.",02:03:49,Sondland
1720,Section_3,PART 4 OF 5 ENDS [,],02:04:04,Sondland
1721,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"You got a doozy of a statement from me this morning. There’s a whole bunch of stuff you don’t recall. So all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candor, but let’s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.",02:04:00,Sondland
1722,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"So my question is, when the president’s putting pressure on the Ukrainians withholding a meeting to get this investigation that you and I agree would benefit him politically, what kind of position does that put the Ukrainians in, sir?",02:04:12,Sondland
1723,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,A terrible position.,02:04:28,Sondland
1724,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,Terrible position. Why?,02:04:29,Sondland
1725,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Why does it put them in a terrible position?,02:04:32,Sondland
1726,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,Why?,02:04:34,Sondland
1727,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, obviously they’re not receiving ultimately what they thought was coming to them and they’re put in a position that jeopardizes their security.",02:04:36,Sondland
1728,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"A position that jeopardizes their security and they’re being asked to do an investigation to help their security essentially, that would benefit the president politically. In other words, you might say they’re being asked to give him a personal benefit in exchange for an official act. Is that a fair summary?",02:04:50,Sondland
1729,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,In your hypothetical that’s correct.,02:05:09,Sondland
1730,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"That’s not a hypothetical, sir. This is real life. Were they asked to give him a personal benefit-",02:05:11,Sondland
1731,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,By whom?,02:05:18,Sondland
1732,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,in exchange for an official act.,02:05:18,Sondland
1733,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Sir, I am not going to go around in circles with you. Please be clear about what you’re asking me.",02:05:20,Sondland
1734,Section_3,Rep. Maloney,"My time is expired, sir. Thank you for your appearance.",02:05:25,Sondland
1735,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Ms. Deming’s,02:05:28,Sondland
1736,Section_3,Demings,"Good afternoon, ambassador. It’s Good to see you again.",02:05:33,Sondland
1737,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Thank you.,02:05:36,Sondland
1738,Section_3,Demings,"Do you have any knowledge of a possible meeting on or around May 7th, involving then president elect Zelensky and several of his aides to discuss how to handle pressure from President Trump and Mr. Giuliani about investigating the Bidens?",02:05:38,Sondland
1739,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall such a meeting.,02:06:00,Sondland
1740,Section_3,Demings,You don’t recall such a meeting? You don’t recall hearing anything about such a meeting? If you don’t have firsthand knowledge.,02:06:02,Sondland
1741,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, if I don’t have records, schedules… right now I don’t recall anything about such a meeting. Is this a meeting among the Ukrainians?",02:06:08,Sondland
1742,Section_3,Demings,The meeting among the Ukrainians involving then President Elect’s Zelensky. So this would have been early on in his presidency with several aides to discuss how to handle pressure from President Trump and Mr. Giuliani about investigating the Bidens.,02:06:21,Sondland
1743,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yeah. I don’t recall such a meeting.,02:06:38,Sondland
1744,Section_3,Demings,"You don’t remember that. Ambassador, in the May, I believe it was the May 23rd meeting, you talked about how the president categorized Ukraine, what he thought about Ukraine. I believe that meeting was on May 23rd. Did you ever hear president Zelensky relay any concerns about you, about how he felt about how the United States viewed him, whether he was being taken seriously or any concerns about being used as a tool for political reasons?",02:06:39,Sondland
1745,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I saw that in an email from Ambassador Taylor. We obviously tried to relay to President Zelensky the glass half full version of how the United States felt about Ukraine, not the glass half empty version, which is we’re here for you, we support you and we’re trying very hard to get you the meeting with President Trump.",02:07:12,Sondland
1746,Section_3,Demings,"So after hearing that from Ambassador Taylor, you relayed… you tried to reassure president Zelensky that America was truly on their side. Is that what you just said?",02:07:34,Sondland
1747,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I think we’ve been trying to assure President Zelensky throughout his entire term as a president.,02:07:43,Sondland
1748,Section_3,Demings,"Ambassador, I know you said you don’t quite remember exactly when you came to the realization that Burisma actually meant Bidens. But back on May 6, when asked about a news report about the role of former vice president’s son on Burisma, President Trump told Fox News that it was, and I quote, “A major scandal, major problem.” On May 9th, the New York Times reported that Rudy Giuliani planned to travel to Ukraine and quote, “Shortly to meet with president Zelensky to urge him to pursue the 2016 election and the involvement of Hunter Biden in Burisma” unquote. Are you saying that you did not realize at that time, we’re talking about on May 9th, of this year that Mr. Giuliani wanted to urge President Zelensky to pursue the 2016 election and the involvement of Hunter Biden of Burisma?",02:07:49,Sondland
1749,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I do now, but I did not then.",02:08:48,Sondland
1750,Section_3,Demings,"You did not know that even… and I believe you said earlier that you did not pay any attention or much attention at all to any of the numerous news reports of the person you were directed by the president to work with, when he was on television over and over and over again talking about Hunter Biden and Burisma.",02:08:50,Sondland
1751,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"No, I did not.",02:09:10,Sondland
1752,Section_3,Demings,"On September 9th, in a text from Ambassador Taylor, he said something to the effect, are we now saying that aid is tied to investigations, and I believe you text back, call me. Then you had a conversation with President Trump and President Trump said something to the effect that there is no quid pro quo. Do you know what prompted him to say that? You asked him what do you want and he goes directly to there is no quid pro quo as opposed to going directly to the list of things that he wanted. What prompted him to use that term?",02:09:12,Sondland
1753,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I have no clue.,02:09:48,Sondland
1754,Section_3,Demings,Did you discuss your text from Ambassador Taylor with President Trump before he made that statement?,02:09:49,Sondland
1755,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I did not. I asked a very open ended question, what do you want from Ukraine?",02:09:57,Sondland
1756,Section_3,Demings,"And you remember that directly, although there are several other conversations that you cannot recall because you don’t have your notes or your documents or your emails or other information, but you remember that call specifically exactly what the president said to you in response to your question about what do you want, why is that?",02:10:00,Sondland
1757,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I remember the first girl I kissed. I mean I remember-,02:10:20,Sondland
1758,Section_3,Demings,"You kissed the… well, I won’t say, but anyway.",02:10:22,Sondland
1759,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I remember that conversation because, as I said, it was a pretty intense short conversation.",02:10:29,Sondland
1760,Section_3,Demings,And tell me again about the conversation you had at the restaurant that was overheard by Mr. Holmes because that was a conversation with the president. Tell me about that conversation with the president. What was said on the phone?,02:10:33,Sondland
1761,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I don’t remember the specifics. I’m being guided by what Mr. Holmes testified to. I said I didn’t dispute the basic subject of the conversation. As I said, we were talking primarily about ASAP Rocky. That was a completely unrelated matter and I think the president may have brought up, how’d it go with Zelensky or is he going to do the investigations, which we’d been talking about for weeks and then as I said, I dispute the… is it Mr. Holmes characterization of what I said afterwards?",02:10:47,Sondland
1762,Section_3,Demings,"Thank you ambassador. Mr. Chair, I yield back.",02:11:22,Sondland
1763,Section_3,Adam Schiff,Mr. Krishnamoorthi.,02:11:23,Sondland
1764,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"Good afternoon, ambassador. I’m going to pick up on that September 9th, conversation in which the president allegedly said, “I want nothing. I don’t want a quid pro quo.” I presume that on this September 9th conversation, the president did not mention that that was the same day that we launched a congressional investigation into whether there was a quid pro quo. Did he say that to you?",02:11:27,Sondland
1765,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I know all of that today, but he did not. We didn’t have time to talk about things like that.",02:11:53,Sondland
1766,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,And I presume he also didn’t mention the whistleblower complaint that also alleged that there was a quid pro quo that day.,02:11:57,Sondland
1767,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,He did not.,02:12:03,Sondland
1768,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,Okay. So you can’t rule out the possibility that the reason why he started talking that way on that day is because of the congressional investigation.,02:12:04,Sondland
1769,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I can’t rule that out.,02:12:12,Sondland
1770,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"The inauguration of President Zelensky was on May 20th, correct?",02:12:15,Sondland
1771,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,02:12:19,Sondland
1772,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"As you stated, you attended this inauguration with Senator Johnson, Secretary Perry, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, and others, right?",02:12:20,Sondland
1773,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,02:12:28,Sondland
1774,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"But Vice President Pence was supposed to originally attend that, correct?",02:12:28,Sondland
1775,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I believe so.,02:12:34,Sondland
1776,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"We learned from Jennifer Williams, a witness who testified, that it was at the president’s direction on May 13th, that the vice president not attend. She said, quote “That according to the vice president’s chief of staff, the president determined that the vice president would not go.” Do you know why the vice president did not attend the inauguration?",02:12:35,Sondland
1777,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,No clue.,02:12:56,Sondland
1778,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"I want to point to a New York Times article from last week that says that Lev Parnas’ attorney, if you’ve heard of this gentleman Lev Parnas, an associated Rudy Giuliani.",02:12:57,Sondland
1779,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Only what I’ve read very recently.,02:13:08,Sondland
1780,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,He was recently indicted.,02:13:09,Sondland
1781,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Yeah.,02:13:11,Sondland
1782,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"Mr. Parnas told a representative of of the incoming government, the Zelensky government, that it had to announce an investigation into Trump’s political rival, Joseph R. Biden and his son, or else Vice President Mike Pence would not attend the swearing in of the new president and the United States would freeze aid. Did the vice president not attend possibly because this investigation had not yet been initiated by the Zelensky government?",02:13:12,Sondland
1783,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I have no idea.,02:13:39,Sondland
1784,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"You can’t rule it out, right?",02:13:41,Sondland
1785,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Again, I have no idea.",02:13:42,Sondland
1786,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"You have no basis for ruling it out, however. Correct?",02:13:44,Sondland
1787,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,All I know is that the leader of the delegation was Secretary Perry who invited me along.,02:13:48,Sondland
1788,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"Interestingly, Ambassador Sondland, since you came forward in these proceedings, others in the administration have tried to distance themselves from you. And on October 14th, Rudy Giuliani told the Washington Post that Sondland quote, “Seemed to be in charge,” close quote of the effort to get Ukrainian officials to publish or to publicly announce investigations. Of course, that’s false correct?",02:13:55,Sondland
1789,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"If I had been in charge, I would have asked President Trump to have the meeting without preconditions and the meeting would have occurred long time ago.",02:14:23,Sondland
1790,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,That’s exactly right. The president is the one that wanted these investigations as we learned later on and in reading the July 25th call transcript. Isn’t that right?,02:14:30,Sondland
1791,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"The president through Mr. Giuliani, as conveyed through Mr. Giuliani wanted the investigations.",02:14:41,Sondland
1792,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"Mr. Tim Morrison came in yesterday and in his deposition testimony, as well as yesterday, disparaged you, too. He called you quote unquote “the Gordon problem.”",02:14:46,Sondland
1793,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s what my wife calls me. Maybe they’re talking. Should I be worried?,02:14:57,Sondland
1794,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"Maybe. You know on October 8th of this year, the president tweeted that you are “a really good man and a great American” and of course on November 8th one month later he said, “Let me just tell you, I hardly know the gentleman.”",02:15:07,Sondland
1795,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Easy come, easy go.",02:15:25,Sondland
1796,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"You know what I’m concerned about, you were part of the three amigos. But what I’m really concerned about, Ambassador Sondland, is that the president and the good folks over here, my republican colleagues are now casting you as the one amigo, the one lonely amigo they’re going to throw under the bus. But the truth is that, as you said in your opening statement, the suggestion that you were engaged in some rogue diplomacy or irregular channel of diplomacy is quote unquote “absolutely false.” Isn’t that right?",02:15:27,Sondland
1797,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,That’s correct.,02:16:09,Sondland
1798,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,The presumption that military aid was conditioned on investigations was based on Mulvaney’s statement that we saw on the video. Isn’t that right?,02:16:11,Sondland
1799,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"Well, I didn’t have the benefit at that time of Mulvaney’s statement.",02:16:20,Sondland
1800,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"But you would stand by the presumption that you had based on what you know now, right?",02:16:24,Sondland
1801,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Correct.,02:16:28,Sondland
1802,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,"And on September 1, when you told Andrii Yermak your presumption, which you’ve told us about military aid being conditioned on the investigations, you then told Mr. Morrison what you told Yermak and Morrison did not try to dispute your presumption, correct?",02:16:29,Sondland
1803,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,"I don’t recall him disputing it. I think I went right over to him and just repeated the conversation. And when you told Vice President Pence your concerns, he did not dispute that as well.",02:16:48,Sondland
1804,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,He didn’t respond. He just listened.,02:17:00,Sondland
1805,Section_3,Adam Schiff,The time of gentleman is expired.,02:17:02,Sondland
1806,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,And when you told Secretary Pompeo that wasn’t disputed as well?,02:17:02,Sondland
1807,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I don’t recall.,02:17:06,Sondland
1808,Section_3,Krishnamoorthi,Thank you.,02:17:10,Sondland
1809,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"That concludes the member questioning. Mr.. Nunes, do you have any closing remarks?",02:17:10,Sondland
1810,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Just briefly. Ambassador, I know you want to get on a plane. So I want to thank you for your indulgence today. Once again, the American people have seen another failure of their preposterous conspiracy theory, which that’s if their conspiracy theory doesn’t change between now and our next hearing, which is in a few hours from now or another hour or so, and it keeps changing every day.",02:17:16,Sondland
1811,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"The claim, ambassador, that you were accused of having an irregular channel, drug deals, now supposedly you’re one amigo, nobody on this side of the aisle claimed that you were one amigo.",02:17:42,Sondland
1812,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,I lost my amigos.,02:17:56,Sondland
1813,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Yeah, not from us. Not from us. No bribes given to… that you’ve made any bribes to the Ukrainian people or to the Ukrainian president. Your co-conspirator, Kurt Volker, I find it remarkable and troubling how the democrats and their collaborators in the press have been able to vilify ambassador Volker, who was supposed to work on these matters in Ukraine. Like you, ambassador, it was a very regular channel and no amount of storytelling by the left and the Democrats on this dais will change that. It was the regular channel.",02:17:58,Sondland
1814,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Testimony received today was far from compelling, conclusive and provides zero evidence of any of the crimes that have been alleged. In fact, Ambassador Sondland testified that he presumed the temporary pause in military aid was conditioned on Ukraine carrying out the investigations the democrats are desperate to portray as nefarious. The democrats have, as their custom, seized on this presumption as proof they can use it against the president.",02:18:44,Sondland
1815,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"However, Ambassador Sondland testified in his deposition that when he asked President Trump, “What do you want from Ukraine?” President Trump replied, “I want nothing. There is no quid pro quo.” Let me repeat. President Trump said, “I want nothing. There is no quid pro quo.” This comes on the Heels of the testimony by Ambassador Volker that he saw no evidence of bribery, extortion, quid pro quo or treasonous actions. We didn’t get to ask him about obstruction of justice because we didn’t know that was on the table until today.",02:19:14,Sondland
1816,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"Like the president’s call with President Zelensky, democrats want the American people to believe, as one democrat on this committee put it, that hearsay is much better than direct evidence. And I think Mr. Ratcliffe from Texas laid out the direct evidence that we have from your testimony today. Nothing we have heard establishes a claim that the president acted improperly in his dealings with Ukraine. And certainly nothing has been presented to support anything near impeachment.",02:19:53,Sondland
1817,Section_3,Devin Nunes,"In the meantime, Mr. Chair, we continue to have no answers to the questions that only you know, starting with who was the whistleblower who gave birth to this hoax and what was the nature of his coordination with the democrats on this committee. Second, what is the full extent of Ukraine’s election meddling against the Trump campaign in 2016 and finally, why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden? What did he do for them and did his position impact any U S government actions under the Obama administration? another hearing in the books and no answers to basic three material actual questions that we need answers to. Yield back and thank you, ambassador, for being here.",02:20:24,Sondland
1818,Section_3,Gordon Sondland,Thank you.,02:21:10,Sondland
1819,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"I thank the ranking member for his remarks. Mr. Sondland, thank you for your testimony today. This is a seminal moment in our investigation and the evidence you have brought forward is deeply significant and troubling. It’s been a long hearing and I know Americans watching you throughout the country may not have had the opportunity to watch all of it. So I’m going to go through a few of the highlights and I’m not going to try to paraphrase what you said. I’m going to refer to your opening statement.",02:21:11,Sondland
1820,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"“We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders. Mr. Giuliani’s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election, DNC server, and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States and we knew that these investigations were important to the president.” Later, you testified, “I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. In the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 election and Burisma as Mr. Giuliani had demanded. I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson and I also shared my concern with the Ukrainians.” So much for the Ukrainians didn’t know. You can’t have a quid pro quo unless the Ukrainians know and you have testified today, ambassador, the Ukrainians knew.",02:21:44,Sondland
1821,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"You further testified, ” Mr. Giuliani emphasized that the president wanted a public statement from president Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into corruption issues. Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election including the DNC server and Burisma as two topics of importance to the president. In reference to the July 10th meeting at the White House, which you attended with Ambassador Bolton and others and Ukrainian delegation, you said, “I recall mentioning the prerequisite of investigations before any White House call or meeting.”",02:23:26,Sondland
1822,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"You further testified, “Again, Mr. Giuliani’s demand that President Zelensky make a public statement about investigations, I knew that the topic of investigations was important to President Trump.” You testified later, “I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question. Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes. We all understood these prerequisites for the White House call and White House meeting reflected president Trump’s desires and requirements.”",02:24:13,Sondland
1823,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Later, on the subject of security aid, you testified “In the absence of any credible explanation for the hold, I came to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized in preparation for the September 1 meeting in Warsaw. I asked Secretary Pompeo whether a face to face conversation between Trump with Zelensky could help break the log jam.” And this is from an email that the state department refuses to provide to us, but you have provided to us, ambassador. It reads, “Should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull aside for POTUS to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look him in the eye,” that is the president, “and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place in mid September, that Z should be able to move forward publicly with confidence on those issues of importance to POTUS and to the United States. Hopefully that will break the log jam.”",02:25:07,Sondland
1824,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"And secretary Pompeo’s reply, “Yes.” Not what issues importance to the POTUS. Not what are you talking about Ambassador Sondland? because Secretary Pompeo was on the July 25th phone call, he knew what issues were important to POTUS and there were two of them. The investigation into 2016 and the DNC server and the investigation into the Bidens.",02:26:08,Sondland
1825,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"By the end of August you testified, “My belief was that if Ukraine did something to demonstrate a serious intention to fight corruption, specifically addressing Burisma and the 2016 server, then the hold on military aid would be lifted. I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations.” And as you testified, he gave you no response. No what are you talking about, ambassador? How could that be, ambassador? How do we clear this up, ambassador? He merely nodded his head or took it in. And of course the record of that 25th call between President Trump and Zelensky was in the vice president’s reading book earlier. Then you testified, “My goal at the time was to do what was necessary to get the aid released, to break the log jam. I believe that the public statement we had been discussing for weeks was essential to advancing that goal.”",02:26:40,Sondland
1826,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now, my colleagues seem to believe, and let me add, too, about this call you had with the president you have confirmed today, in addition to claiming there was no quid pro quo, the president was adamant that President Zelensky had to quote “Clear things up and do it in public.” That’s what you have confirmed. That is what you also told Ambassador Taylor. So he would deny there was a quid pro quo, but he was adamant that Zelensky had to quote “Clear things up and do it in public.”",02:27:46,Sondland
1827,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now, I’ve said a lot of things about President Trump over the years, I have very strong feelings about President Trump, which are neither here nor there. But I will say this on the president’s behalf, I do not believe that the president would allow himself to be led by the nose by Rudy Giuliani or Ambassador Sondland or anybody else. I think the president was the one who decided whether a meeting would happen, whether aid would be lifted, not anyone who worked for him. And so the answer to the question, who was refusing the meeting with Zelensky that you believed should take place and Ambassador Volker believed should take place and everybody believed should take place, the only question was when? Who was the one standing in the way of that meeting? Who was the one refusing to take that meeting? There’s only one answer to that question and it’s Donald J. Trump, 45th president of the United States.",02:28:22,Sondland
1828,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"So who was holding up the military assistance? Was it you Ambassador Sondland? No, it wasn’t. Was it ambassador Volker? No. Was it Ambassador Taylor? No. Was it Deputy Secretary Kent? No. Was it Secretary of State Pompeo? No. Who had the decision to release the aid? It was one person, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States.",02:29:20,Sondland
1829,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"Now my colleagues seem to think unless the president says the magic words that I hear by bribe Ukrainians, that there’s no evidence of bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors, but let’s look to the best evidence of what’s in the president’s head. What’s his intent? What’s the reason behind the hold on the meeting and on the aid? Let’s look at what the president has to say. Let’s look at what’s undisputed about what the president has to say. And you know how we know what the president has to say, not because what you have represented or others have represented, but because we have a record of his conversation and with who? The one who really matters with the other president, Zelensky. and this is what he says. He says, “Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy.” This is after he says he wants a favor and he goes into CrowdStrike in 2016 he says, “Rudy very much knows what’s happening and is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him, that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman was bad news and the people she was dealing with in Ukraine were bad news. So I just want to let you know that the other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son. That Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general, that would be great. Biden went about bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you could look into it, it sounds horrible to me.”",02:29:46,Sondland
1830,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"So what’s in the president’s mind when he has placed this otherwise inexplicable hold on the aid, when he refuses to take the meeting. What’s on his mind? Biden. He makes that abundantly clear. I understand, ambassador, you said you didn’t make the connection between Burisma and Biden. I will let the American people judge the credibility of that answer, but there’s no mistaking what Donald Trump’s interest was. There’s no mistaking about what Donald Trump meant when he had that call with you on an unsecure phone as you’re sitting there at an outdoor terrace in Ukraine. When the president said an investigation, he meant Biden. He made that abundantly clear to the president of Ukraine the day before.",02:31:21,Sondland
1831,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"The question is not what the president meant. The question is not whether he was responsible for holding up the aid. He was. The question is not whether everybody knew it. Apparently they did. The question is, what are we prepared to do about it? Is there any accountability or are we forced to conclude that this is just now the world that we live in? When a President of the United States can withhold vital military aid from an ally at war with the Russians, an ally fighting our fight too, to defend our country against Russian aggression. Are we prepared to say in the words of Mick Mulvaney “Get over it or get used to it?”",02:32:07,Sondland
1832,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"We’re not prepared to say that. We’re not prepared to say that. And I appreciate Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, I appreciate the fact that you have not opined on whether the president should be impeached or not be impeached or whether the crime of bribery or the impeachable offense of bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors has been committed. That is for us to decide in consultation with our constituents and our conscience. That is for us to decide. And much as my colleagues have said otherwise, this is not an easy decision for any of us. And much as my colleagues may say otherwise, this is not something we relish",02:32:53,Sondland
1833,Section_3,Adam Schiff,"For over a year I resisted this whole idea of going down the road to impeachment, but it was made necessary. And not by the whistle blower, but by the actions of the president. I’m continually struck how my colleagues would suggest that because the president got caught, we should ignore the fact that he was conditioning official acts in order to get political favors, in order to get an investigation against his rival. Getting caught is no defense, not to a violation of the constitution or to a violation of his oath of office. And it certainly doesn’t give us a reason to ignore our own oath of office. We are adjourned.",02:33:34,Sondland
0,Section_0,Adam Schiff,"Ask for your respect as we proceed with today’s hearing. It’s the intention of the committee to proceed without disruptions. As chairman, I’ll take all necessary and appropriate steps to maintain order and ensure that the committee is run in accordance with House rules and House Resolution 660. With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.",00:00,Hill/Holmes
1,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Yesterday morning, the Committee heard from Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the American Ambassador to the European Union, the de facto leader of the three amigos, who had regular access to President Donald Trump and pressed the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for two investigations, Trump believed would help his reelection campaign. The first investigation was of a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine and not Russia was responsible for interfering in our 2016 election. The second investigation was into the political rival Trump apparently feared most, Joe Biden. Trump sought to weaken Biden, and to refute the fact that his own election had been helped by a Russian hacking and dumping operation and Russian social media campaign directed by Vladimir Putin.",00:23,Hill/Holmes
2,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Trump’s scheme stood in contrast to the longstanding bipartisan foreign policy of the United States by undermining military and diplomatic support for a key ally, and set back US anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. In conditioning a meeting with Zelensky and then military aid on securing an investigation of his rival, Trump put his personal and political interests above those of the United States. Ambassador Sondland would later tell career Foreign Service Officer, David Holmes, immediately after speaking to the president, Trump did not give a expletive about Ukraine. He cares about big stuff that benefits him, like the Biden investigation that Giuliani was pushing.",01:12,Hill/Holmes
3,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"David Holmes is here with us today. He is a Foreign Service Officer currently serving as the Political Counselor at the US Embassy in Kyiv. Also with us is Dr. Fiona Hill, whose job as the National Security Council’s Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs encompassed the coordination of US policy towards Ukraine. Dr. Hill left the NSC in July, after more than two years in that position. Dr. Hill and Mr. Holmes each provide a unique perspective on issues relating to Ukraine, Dr. Hill from Washington, DC, and Mr. Holmes from on the ground in Kyiv.",01:54,Hill/Holmes
4,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In early 2019, Dr. Hill became concerned by the increasing prominence of Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, who was, as she has testified, asserting quite frequently on television in public appearances that he had been given some authority over matters related to Ukraine. Hill was not alone in her concerns. Her boss, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, was also paying attention, as were other NSC and State Department officials, including Holmes at the US Embassy in Kyiv. Bolton viewed Giuliani as a hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up, and was powerless to prevent the former mayor from engineering former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch’s firing in late April or the recall. Holmes was stunned by the intensity and consistency of the media attacks on Yovanovitch, by name as a US Ambassador and the scope of the allegations that were leveled against her.",02:29,Hill/Holmes
5,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Yovanovitch’s dismissal as a result of Giuliani’s smear campaign was one of several things that unsettled Dr. Hill. Another was the role of Gordon Sondland, who emerged as a key player in Ukraine policy in May when he was named as part of the US delegation led by Secretary, Rick Perry, to President Zelensky’s inauguration. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, also attended the inauguration, and as Holmes recalls, during a meeting with President Zelensky, took the opportunity to advise the new Ukrainian leader to stay out of US domestic politics.",03:28,Hill/Holmes
6,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Another concern that arose for Dr. Hill around this time was her discovery of a potential NSC back channel on Ukraine. Hill learned that an NSC staff member who did not work on Ukraine and for her may have been providing Ukraine-related information to President Trump that Dr. Hill was not made aware of. According to Holmes, following the Zelensky inauguration, Sondland and Perry took a very active and unconventional role in formulating our priorities for the new Zelensky administration and personally reaching out to President Zelensky and his senior team. Sondland’s newfound assertiveness also concerned Dr. Hill, who previously had enjoyed a cordial working relationship with the ambassador.",04:05,Hill/Holmes
7,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"On June 18, 2019, Hill had a blow-up with Sondland when he told her that he was in charge of Ukraine policy. Dr. Hill testified that Sondland got testy with me. And I said, “Who has put you in charge of it?” He said, “The President.” On July 10th, Dr. Hill was part of a meeting at the White House with a group of US and Ukrainian officials, including Bolton, Sondland and Energy Secretary, Perry, another of the three amigos. The meeting was intended, among other things, to give the Ukrainians an opportunity to convey that they were very anxious to set up a meeting, a first meeting between their new president and President Trump. Sondland interjected to inform the group that according to White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, the White House meeting sought by the Ukrainian president with Trump would happen if Ukraine undertook certain investigations. Hearing this, Bolton abruptly ended the meeting.",04:47,Hill/Holmes
8,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Undeterred, Sondland brought the Ukrainian delegation and the NSC Director for Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman downstairs to another part of the White House, where they were later joined by Dr. Hill. In this second meeting, Sondland was more explicit. Ukraine needed to conduct investigations if they were to get a meeting at all. Bolton directed Dr. Hill to report this to NSC legal advisor, John Eisenberg, telling her, “You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go ahead and tell him what you’ve heard and what I’ve said.” Dr. Hill did so, as did Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, who separately approached the same lawyers with his concerns.",05:43,Hill/Holmes
9,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"On July 18, the day before Dr. Hill left her post at the NSC, Holmes participated in a secure interagency videoconference on Ukraine. Towards the end of the meeting, a representative from the Office of Management and Budget announced that the flow of nearly $400 million in security assistance for Ukraine was being held up. The order had come from the president and had been conveyed to OMB by acting White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, without further explanation. Holmes, unaware of the hold prior to the call, was shocked. He thought the suspension of aid was extremely significant, undermining what he had understood to be longstanding US national security goals in Ukraine.",06:26,Hill/Holmes
10,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"One week later, on July 25th, President Trump spoke with President Zelensky by phone. When President Zelensky brought up US military support and noted that Ukraine would like to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States, Trump responded by saying, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.” Trump then requested that Zelensky investigate the discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US election. Even more ominously, Trump asked Zelensky to look into the Bidens. Neither request had been included in the official talking points for the call prepared by the NSC staff, but both were in Donald Trump’s personal interest, and in the interests of his 2020 re-election campaign. And the Ukrainian president knew about both in advance, in part because of efforts by Ambassadors Sondland and Volker to make him aware of President Trump’s demands.",07:12,Hill/Holmes
11,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"The next day, July 26, in Kyiv, Holmes served as a note-taker during a meeting between acting Ambassador Bill Taylor, Volker and Sondland, with President Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian officials. Zelensky said that on the previous day’s call, President Trump had “three times” raised some very sensitive issues that he would have to follow up on those issues when they met in person. Although he did not realize it at the time, Holmes came to understand that the sensitive issues were the investigations that President Trump demanded on the July 25th call.",08:06,Hill/Holmes
12,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Following the meeting with Zelensky, Holmes accompanied Sondland to a separate meeting with one of the Ukrainian president’s top advisors, Andriy Yermak. But Holmes was not allowed into the meeting and waited for thirty minutes while Sondland and the Ukrainian met alone without any note-takers to record what they said. After the meeting, Sondland, Holmes and two other State Department staff went to lunch at a nearby restaurant and sat on an outdoor terrace. At some point during the meal, Sondland pulled out his cell phone, placed a call to the White House, and asked to be connected to the President.",08:52,Hill/Holmes
13,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"When Trump came on the line, Holmes could hear the President’s voice clearly. Holmes recalled that “the President’s voice was very loud and recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume.” Sondland said he was calling from Kyiv. He told the President that President Zelensky loves your ass. Holmes then heard President Trump ask, “So he’s going to do the investigation?” Ambassador Sondland replied, ” He’s going to do it,” adding that, “President Zelensky will do anything you ask him.”",09:29,Hill/Holmes
14,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"After the call ended, Holmes took the opportunity to ask Sondland for his candid impression of the President’s views on Ukraine. It was at this point that Sondland revealed that President Trump doesn’t give a expletive about Ukraine. The President only cares about big stuff, that benefits the president, like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing. A month later, National Security Advisor, Bolton, traveled to Kyiv. Between meetings with Ukrainian government officials, Holmes heard Bolton express to Ambassador Bill Taylor his frustration about Mr. Giuliani’s influence with the President. Bolton made clear, however, there was nothing he could do about it. Bolton further stated that the hold on security assistance would not be lifted prior to the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Zelensky in Warsaw, where it would hang on whether Zelensky was able to favorably impress President Trump.",10:07,Hill/Holmes
15,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Trump canceled his trip to Warsaw, but Sondland, Volker and others continued to press for a public announcement of the opening of investigations by Zelensky. On September 8, Taylor told Holmes that, “Now they’re insisting Zelensky commit to the investigation in an interview with CNN.” Holmes was surprised the requirement was so specific and concrete, since it amounted to nothing less than a ” demand that President Zelensky personally commit to a specific investigation of President Trump’s political rival on a cable news channel.”",11:03,Hill/Holmes
16,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"On September 9, this Committee along with the Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees, launched our investigation of this corrupt scheme. President Trump released the hold on aid two days later. As CNN’s Fareed Zakaria has revealed, the Ukrainians canceled the CNN interview shortly thereafter. Two weeks later, on September 25, the transcript of the July 25th call was released by the White House, and the details of the President’s scheme started coming into view.",11:41,Hill/Holmes
17,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"In the coming days, Congress will determine what response is appropriate. If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe a vulnerable ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts, a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid, it will be for us to decide whether those acts are compatible with the Office of the Presidency. I now recognize ranking member Nunes for any remarks he would like to make.",12:10,Hill/Holmes
18,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Thank you. Throughout these bizarre hearings, the Democrats have struggled to make the case that President Trump committed some impeachable offense on his phone call with Ukrainian president Zelensky. The offense itself changes depending on the day ranging from quid pro quo to extortion, to bribery, to obstruction of justice, then back to quid pro quo. It’s clear why the Democrats have been forced onto this carousel of accusations. President Trump had good reason to be wary of Ukrainian election meddling against his campaign and of widespread corruption in that country. President Zelensky, who didn’t even know aid to Ukraine had been paused at the time of the call, has repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with the conversation. The aid was resumed without the Ukrainians taking the actions they were supposedly being coerced into doing.",12:46,Hill/Holmes
19,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Aid to Ukraine under President Trump has been much more robust than it was under President Obama. Thanks to the provision of Javelin anti-tank weapons. As numerous witnesses have testified, temporary holds on foreign aid occur fairly frequently for many different reasons. So how do we have an impeachable offense here when there’s no actual misdeed and no one even claiming to be a victim? The Democrats have tried to solve this dilemma with a simple slogan, “he got caught.” President Trump, we are to believe, was just about to do something wrong and getting caught was the only reason he backed down from whatever nefarious thought crime the Democrats are accusing him of almost committing.",13:47,Hill/Holmes
20,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"I once again urge Americans to continue to consider the credibility of the Democrats on this Committee, who are now hurling these charges for the last three years. It’s not president Trump who got caught, it’s the Democrats who got caught. They got caught falsely claiming they had more than circumstantial evidence that Trump colluded with Russians to hack the 2016 election. They got caught orchestrating this entire farce with the whistleblower and lying about their secret meetings with him. They got caught defending the false allegations of the Steele dossier, which was paid for by them. They got caught breaking their promise that impeachment would only go forward with bipartisan support because of how damaging it is to the American people.",14:44,Hill/Holmes
21,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"They got caught running a sham impeachment process between secret depositions, hidden transcripts, and an unending flood of Democrat leaks to the media. They got caught trying to obtain nude photos of President Trump from Russian pranksters pretending to be Ukrainians, and they got caught covering up for Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic National Committee operative, who colluded with Ukrainian officials to smear the Trump campaign by improperly redacting her name from deposition transcripts, and refusing to let Americans hear her testimony as a witness in these proceedings. That is the Democrats pitiful legacy in recent years. They got caught.",15:52,Hill/Holmes
22,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"Meanwhile, their supposed star witness testified that he was guessing that President Trump was tying Ukrainian aid to investigations despite no one telling him that was true, and the president himself explicitly telling him the opposite, that he wanted nothing from Ukraine. Ladies and gentlemen, unless the Democrats once again scramble their kangaroo court rules, today’s hearing marks the merciful end of this spectacle in the Impeachment Committee, formerly known as the Intelligence Committee. Whether the Democrats reap the political benefit they want from this impeachment remains to be seen, but the damage they have done to this country will be long lasting. Will this wrenching attempt to overthrow the president? They have pitted Americans against one another and poison the mind of fanatics who actually believe the entire galaxy of bizarre accusations. They have level against the president since the day the American people elected him.",16:53,Hill/Holmes
23,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"I sincerely hope the Democrats in this affair as quickly as possible so our nation can begin to heal the many wounds it has inflicted on us. The people’s faith in government and their belief that their vote counts for something has been shaken. From the Russia hoax to this shotty Ukrainian sequel, the Democrats got caught. Let’s hope they finally learn a lesson, give their conspiracy theories a rest, and focus on governing for a change. In addition, Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Rule XI, clause 2(j)(1), the Republican members transmit a request to convene a minority day of hearings. Today you have blocked key witnesses that we have requested from testifying in this partisan impeachment inquiry. This rule was not displaced by H.Res.660, and therefore under House Rule 11 clause 1(a), it applies to the Democrats impeachment inquiry. We look forward to the chair promptly scheduling an agreed upon time for the minority day of hearings so that we can hear from key witnesses that you have continually blocked from testifying.",18:06,Hill/Holmes
24,Section_1,Devin Nunes,"I’d also like to take a quick moment on an assertion Ms. Hill made in the statement that she submitted to this Committee, in which she claimed that some Committee members deny that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. As I noted in my opening statement on Wednesday, but in March, 2018, Intelligence Committee Republicans published the results of a year long investigation into Russian meddling. The 240 page report analyzed 2016 Russian meddling campaign, the US government reaction to it, Russian campaigns in other countries and provided specific recommendations to improve American election security. I would asked my staff to hand these reports to our two witnesses today just so I can have a recollection of their memory. As America may or may not know, Democrats refused to sign on to the Republican report. Instead, they decided to adopt minority views, filled with collusion conspiracy theories. Needless to say, it is entirely possible for two separate nations to engage in election meddling at the same time, and Republicans believe we should take meddling seriously by all foreign countries regardless of which campaign is the target. I’d like to submit for the record, a copy of our report titled Report on Russian Active Measures. I yield back.",19:26,Hill/Holmes
25,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Today we are joined by Dr. Fiona Hill and David Holmes. Dr Fiona Hill is a former deputy assistant to the president and senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council. Before returning to government, she was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution where she directed the center on the United States in Europe. She previously worked at the National Intelligence Council, the Eurasia Foundation, and the John F. Kennedy School of Government. David Holmes is the Political Counselor at the US Embassy in Kyiv, where he serves as the Senior Policy and Political Advisor to Ambassador Taylor, who testified earlier in these hearings. He is a career Foreign Service Officer. He has previously served in Moscow, New Delhi, Kabul, Bogota and Pristina.

26,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Two final points before our witnesses are sworn. First witness depositions as part of this inquiry were unclassified in nature, and all open hearings will also be held at the unclassified level. Any information that may touch on classified information will be addressed separately. Second, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal, threat of reprisal or attempt to retaliate against any US government official for testifying before Congress, including you or any of your colleagues. If you would please rise, raise your right hand, I will begin by swearing you in. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God. Let the record show that the witness has answered in the affirmative. Thank you and you may be seated.",22:19,Hill/Holmes
27,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"The microphones are sensitive, so you’ll need to speak directly into them. Without objection, your written statements will be made part of the record. With that Mr. Holmes, you are now recognized for your opening statement and when you conclude, Dr. Hill, you’ll be immediately recognized thereafter for your opening statement.",23:11,Hill/Holmes
28,Section_1,David Holmes,"Thank you. Good morning Mr. chairman, Ranking Member Nunes, and members of the Committee. My name is David Holmes, and I’m a career Foreign Service Officer with the Department of State. Since August 2017, I have been a political counselor at the US Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine. While it is an honor to appear before you today, I want to make clear that I did not seek this opportunity to testify today. Since you determined that I may have something of value to these proceedings and issued a subpoena, it is my obligation…",23:34,Hill/Holmes
29,Section_1,David Holmes,"… something of value to these proceedings and issued a subpoena. It is my obligation to appear and to tell you what I know. Indeed, as secretary Pompeo has stated, I hope everyone who testifies will do so truthfully and accurately. When they do, the oversight role will have been performed, and I think America will come to see what took place here. That is my only goal, to testify truthfully and accurately to enable you to perform that role. To that end, I have put together this statement to lay out as best I can, my recollection of events that may be relevant to this matter.",24:03,Hill/Holmes
30,Section_1,David Holmes,"By way of background, I have spent my entire professional career as a foreign service officer. Like many of the dedicated public servants who have testified in these proceedings, my entire career has been in the service of my country. I’m a graduate of Pomona College in Claremont, California and received degrees in international affairs from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and from Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.",24:35,Hill/Holmes
31,Section_1,David Holmes,"I joined the foreign service in 2002 through an apolitical merit-based process under the George W. Bush administration, and I have proudly served administrations of both parties and worked for their appointees, both political and career. Prior to my current post in Kiev, Ukraine, I served in the political and economic sections at the US embassy in Moscow, Russia. In Washington, I served on the national security council staff as director for Afghanistan and as a special assistant to the Under Secretary of State.",25:02,Hill/Holmes
32,Section_1,David Holmes,"My prior overseas assignments include New Delhi, India, Kabul, Afghanistan, Bogota, Colombia, and Pristina, Kosovo. As the political counselor at the US NBC Embassy in Kiev, I lead the political section covering Ukraine’s internal politics, foreign relations and security policies. I serve as the senior policy and political ambassador to the advisor to the ambassador.",25:33,Hill/Holmes
33,Section_1,David Holmes,"The job of an embassy political counselor is to gather information about the host country’s political landscape, to report back to Washington, to represent US policies to foreign contacts, and to advise the ambassador on policy development and implementation. In this role, I’m a senior member of the embassy’s country team and continually involved in addressing issues as they arise. I’m also often called upon to take notes in meetings involving the ambassador or visiting senior US officials with Ukrainian counterparts.",25:57,Hill/Holmes
34,Section_1,David Holmes,"For this reason, I’ve been present in many of the meetings with President Zelensky and his administration, some of which may be germane to this inquiry. While I’m a political counselor at the embassy, it is important to note that I am not a political appointee or engage in US politics in any way. It is not my job to cover or advise on US politics. On the contrary, I’m an apolitical foreign policy professional, and my job is to focus on the politics of the country in which I serve, so that we can better understand the local landscape and better advance US national interests there.",26:29,Hill/Holmes
35,Section_1,David Holmes,"In fact, during the period that we’ll cover today, my colleagues and I followed direct guidance from Ambassador Yovanovitch and Ambassador Taylor to focus on doing our jobs as foreign policy professionals and to stay clear of Washington politics. I arrived in Kiev to take up my assignment as political counselor in August, 2017, a year after Ambassador Yovanovitch received her appointment. From August, 2017 until her removal from post in May, 2019, I was Ambassador Yovanovitch’s chief policy advisor and developed a deep respect for her dedication, determination, decency and professionalism.",27:06,Hill/Holmes
36,Section_1,David Holmes,"During this time, we worked together closely, speaking multiple times per day, and I accompanied Ambassador Yovanovitch to many of her meetings with senior Ukrainian counterparts. Our work in Ukraine focused on three policy priorities: peace and security, economic growth and reform, and anticorruption and rule of law. These policies match the three consistent priorities of the Ukrainian peoples since 2014, as measured in public opinion polling, namely an end to the conflict with Russia that restores national unity and territorial integrity, responsible economic policies that deliver European standards of growth and opportunity, and effective and impartial rule of law institutions that deliver justice in cases of high level official corruption.",27:44,Hill/Holmes
37,Section_1,David Holmes,"Our efforts on this third policy priority merit special mention because it was during Ambassador Yovanovitch’s tenure that we achieved the hard-fought passage of a law establishing an independent court to try corruption cases. These efforts strained Ambassador Yovanovitch’s relationship with former president Poroshenko and some of his allies, including Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, who resisted fully empowering truly independent anti-corruption institutions that would help ensure that no Ukrainians, however powerful, were above the law. Despite this resistance, the ambassador in the embassy kept pushing anticorruption and other priorities of our policy towards Ukraine.",28:32,Hill/Holmes
38,Section_1,David Holmes,"Beginning in March, 2019 the situation at the embassy and in Ukraine changed dramatically. Specifically, the three priorities of security, economy and justice, and our support for Ukrainian democratic resistance to Russian aggression became overshadowed by a political agenda promoted by former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.",29:15,Hill/Holmes
39,Section_1,David Holmes,"That change began with the emergence of press reports, critical of Ambassador Yovanovitch and machinations by then-Prosecutor General Lutsenko and others to discredit her. In mid-March, 2019, an embassy colleague learned from a Ukrainian contact that Mr. Lutsenko had complained that Ambassador Yovanovitch had “destroyed him” with her refusal to support him until he followed through with his reform commitments and ceased using his position for personal gain.",29:42,Hill/Holmes
40,Section_1,David Holmes,"In retaliation. Mr. Lutsenko made a series of unsupported allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch, mostly suggesting that Ambassador Yovanovitch improperly used the embassy to advance the political interests of the democratic party. Among Mr. Lutsenko’s allegations were that the embassy had ordered the investigation of a former Ukrainian official solely because that former official was allegedly the main Ukrainian contact of the Republican Party and of president Trump personally, and that the embassy had allegedly pressured Lutsenko’s predecessor to close a case against a different former Ukrainian official solely because of an alleged connection between that official’s company Burisma and former Vice President Biden’s son.",30:10,Hill/Holmes
41,Section_1,David Holmes,"Mr. Lutsenko also claimed that he had never received $4.4 million in US funds intended for his office, and that there was a tape of a Ukrainian official saying that he was trying to help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election. Finally, Mr. Lutsenko publicly claimed that Ambassador Yovanovitch had given him a “do not prosecute” list containing the names of her supposed allies, an allegation the State Department called an outright fabrication and that Mr. Lutsenko later retracted.",30:51,Hill/Holmes
42,Section_1,David Holmes,"Mr. Lutsenko said that as a result of these allegations, Ambassador Yovanovitch would face serious problems in the United States. Public opinion polls indicated that Ukrainians generally did not believe Mr. Lutsenko’s allegations, and on March 22nd, President Poroshenko issued a statement in support of Ambassador Yovanovitch. Following Mr. Lutsenko’s allegations, Mr. Giuliani and others made a number of public statements critical of Ambassador Yovanovitch, questioning her integrity and calling for her removal from office. Mr Giuliani was also making frequent public statements pushing for Ukraine to investigate interference in the 2016 election and issues related to Burisma and the Bidens.",31:21,Hill/Holmes
43,Section_1,David Holmes,"For example, on May 1st, 2019 The New York times reported that Mr. Giuliani had discussed the Burisma investigation and its intersection with the Bidens with the ousted Ukrainian Prosecutor General and the current prosecutor. On May 9th, The New York times reported that Mr. Giuliani said he planned to travel to Ukraine to pursue investigations into the 2016 election interference and into the involvement of former Vice President Biden’s son in a Ukrainian gas company.",32:04,Hill/Holmes
44,Section_1,David Holmes,"Over the next few months, Mr. Giuliani also issued a series of tweets asking “why Biden shouldn’t be investigated, attacking “the new president of Ukraine Zelensky for being silent on the 2016 election and Biden investigations and complaining about The New York times attacking him for “exposing the Biden family history of making millions from Ukrainian criminals.”",32:33,Hill/Holmes
45,Section_1,David Holmes,"Around this time, the Ukrainian presidential election was approaching, and political newcomer and entertainer Volodymyr Zelensky, who had played a president on television, was surging in the polls, ahead of Mr. Lutsenko’s political ally, President Poroshenko. On April 20th, I was present for Ambassador Yovanovitch’s third and final meeting with then-candidate Zelensky ahead of his landslide victory in the runoff election the next day. As in her two prior meetings that I also attended, they had an entirely cordial, pleasant conversation and signaled their mutual desire to work together.",32:57,Hill/Holmes
46,Section_1,David Holmes,"However, the negative narratives about Ambassador Yovanovitch had gained currency in certain segments of the United States press. On April 26th, Ambassador Yovanovitch departed for Washington DC, where she learned that she would be recalled early. The barrage of allegations directed at Ambassador Yovanovitch, a career ambassador, is unlike anything I’ve seen in my professional career. Following President Elect Zelensky’s victory, our attention in the embassy focused on getting to know the incoming Zelensky administration and on preparations for the inauguration scheduled for May 20th, the same day that Ambassador Yovanovitch departed post permanently.",33:31,Hill/Holmes
47,Section_1,David Holmes,"It quickly became clear that the White House was not prepared to show the level of support for the Zelensky administration that we had originally anticipated. In early May, Mr. Giuliani publicly alleged that Mr. Zelensky was “surrounded by enemies of the US president” and canceled a visit to Ukraine. Shortly thereafter, we learned that Vice President Pence no longer planned to lead the presidential delegation to the inauguration.",34:10,Hill/Holmes
48,Section_1,David Holmes,"The White House then whittled down an initial proposed list for the official presidential delegation to the inauguration from over a dozen individuals to just five. Secretary Perry as its head, Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt Volker, representing the State Department. National Security Council Director Alex Vindman, representing the White House, temporary acting Charge d’Affaires, Joseph Pennington, representing the embassy, and ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland.",34:35,Hill/Holmes
49,Section_1,David Holmes,"While Ambassador Sondland’s mandate as the accredited ambassador to the European Union did not cover individual member states, let alone non-member countries like Ukraine, he made clear that he had direct and frequent access to President Trump and Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and portrayed himself as the conduit to the President and Mr. Mulvaney for this group. Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker later styled themselves the Three Amigos and made clear they would take the lead on coordinating our policy and engagement with the Zelensky administration.",35:04,Hill/Holmes
50,Section_1,David Holmes,"Around the same time, I became aware that Mr. Giuliani, a private lawyer, was taking a direct role in Ukrainian diplomacy. On April 25th, Ivan Bakanov, who was Mr. Zelensky’s childhood friend and campaign chair, and was ultimately appointed as the head of the security services of Ukraine, indicated to me privately that he had been contacted by “someone named Giuliani who said he was an advisor to the Vice President.” I reported Mr. Bakanov’s message to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent.",35:37,Hill/Holmes
51,Section_1,David Holmes,"Over the following months, it became apparent that Mr. Giuliani was having a direct influence on the foreign policy agenda that the Three Amigos were executing on the ground in Ukraine. In fact, at one point during a preliminary meeting of the inaugural delegation, someone wondered aloud why Mr. Giuliani was so active in the media with respect to Ukraine. My recollection is that Ambassador Sondland stated, “Dammit, Rudy. Every time Rudy gets involved, he goes and F’s everything up.”",36:08,Hill/Holmes
52,Section_1,David Holmes,"The inauguration took place on May 20th, and I took notes in the delegations meeting with President Zelensky. During the meeting, Secretary Perry passed President Zelensky a list that Perry described as “people he trusts.” Secretary Perry told President Zelensky that he could seek advice from the people on this list on issues of energy sector reform, which was the topic of subsequent meetings between Secretary Perry and key Ukrainian energy sector contacts. Embassy personnel were excluded from some of these later meetings by Secretary Perry’s staff.",36:38,Hill/Holmes
53,Section_1,David Holmes,"On May 23rd, Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Senator Ron Johnson, who had also attended the inauguration, though not on the official delegation, returned to the United States and briefed President Trump. On May 29th, President Trump signed a congratulatory letter to President Zelensky, which included an invitation to visit the White House at an unspecified date. It is important to understand that a White House visit was critical to President Zelensky. President Zelensky needed to show US support at the highest levels in order to demonstrate to Russian President Putin that he had United States backing, as well as to advance his ambitious anticorruption reform agenda at home.",37:09,Hill/Holmes
54,Section_1,David Holmes,"President Zelensky’s team immediately began pressing to set a date for that visit. President Zelensky and senior members of his team made clear that they wanted President Zelensky’s first overseas trip to be to Washington to send a strong signal of American support and requested a call with President Trump as soon as possible. We at the embassy also believed that a meeting was critical to the success of President Zelensky’s administration and its reform agenda, and we worked hard to get it arranged.",37:54,Hill/Holmes
55,Section_1,David Holmes,"When President Zelensky’s team did not receive a confirmed date for a White House visit, they made alternative plans for President Zelensky’s first overseas trip to be to Brussels instead, in part two attend an American Independence Day event Ambassador Sondland hosted on June 4th. Ambassador Sondland hosted a dinner in President Zelensky’s honor following the reception, which included President Zelensky, Jared Kushner, Secretary Pompeo’s counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, senior European Union officials, and comedian Jay Leno, among others.",38:23,Hill/Holmes
56,Section_1,David Holmes,"Ambassador Bill Taylor arrived in Kiev as Chargé d’Affaires on June 17th. For the next month, a focus of our activities along with those of the Three Amigos, was to coordinate a White House visit. To that end, we were working with Ukrainians to deliver things that we thought President Trump might care about, such as commercial deals that would benefit the United States, which might convince President Trump to agree to a meeting with President Zelensky.",38:57,Hill/Holmes
57,Section_1,David Holmes,"The Ukrainian policy community was unanimous in its recommendation in recognizing the importance of securing the meeting and President Trump’s support. Ambassador Taylor reported that Secretary Pompeo had told him prior to his arrival in Kiev, “We need to work on turning The President around on Ukraine.” Ambassador Volker told us that the next five years could hang on what could be accomplished in the next three months. I took that to mean that if we did not earn President Trump’s support in the next three months, we could lose the opportunity to make progress during President’s Zelensky’s five year term.",39:22,Hill/Holmes
58,Section_1,David Holmes,"Within a week or two, it became apparent that the energy sector reforms, the commercial deals, and the anticorruption efforts on which we were making progress were not making a dent in terms of persuading the White House to schedule a meeting between the presidents. On June 27th, Ambassador Sondland told Ambassador Taylor in a phone conversation, the gist of which Ambassador Taylor shared with me at the time, that President Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that President Zelensky was not standing in the way of “investigations.” I understood that this meant the Biden Burisma investigations that Mr. Giuliani and his associates had been speaking about in the media since March.",39:58,Hill/Holmes
59,Section_1,David Holmes,"While Ambassador Taylor did not brief me on every detail of his communications with the Three Amigos, he did tell me that on a June 28th call with President Zelensky, Ambassador Taylor, and the Three Amigos, it was made clear that some action on Burisma by an investigation was a precondition for an Oval Office visit. Also on June 28th, while President Trump was still not moving forward on a meeting with President Zelensky, we met with … He met with Russian President Putin at the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, sending a further signal of lack of support to Ukraine.",40:39,Hill/Holmes
60,Section_1,David Holmes,"We became concerned that even if a meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky could occur, it would not go well, and I discussed with embassy colleagues whether we should stop seeking a meeting altogether. While the White House visit was critical to the Zelensky administration, a visit that failed to send a clear and strong signal of support likely would be worse for President Zelensky than no visit at all.",41:15,Hill/Holmes
61,Section_1,David Holmes,"Congress has appropriated $1.5 billion in security assistance for Ukraine since 2014. This assistance has provided crucial material and moral support to Ukraine in its defensive war with Russia and has helped Ukraine build its armed forces virtually from scratch into arguably the most capable and battle-hardened land force in Europe. I’ve had the honor of visiting the main training facility in Western Ukraine with members of Congress and members of this very committee, Ms. Stefanik, where we witnessed firsthand US National Guard troops, along with allies, conducting training for Ukrainian soldiers.",41:41,Hill/Holmes
62,Section_1,David Holmes,"Since 2014, National Guard units from California, Oklahoma, New York, Tennessee, and Wisconsin have trained shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainian counterparts. Given the history of US security assistance to Ukraine and the bipartisan recognition of its importance, I was shocked when on July 18th, an office of management and budget staff members surprisingly announced the hold on Ukraine’s security assistance. The announcement came toward the end of a nearly two hour National Security Council secure video conference call, which I participated in from the embassy conference room.",42:22,Hill/Holmes
63,Section_1,David Holmes,"The official said that the order had come from the president and had been conveyed to OMB by Mr. Mulvaney with no further explanation. This began a week or so of efforts by various agencies to identify the rationale for the freeze, to conduct a review of the assistance, and to reaffirm the unanimous view of Ukraine policy community of its important. NSC counterparts confirmed to us that there had been no change in our Ukraine policy but could not determine the cause of the hold or how to lift it.",42:59,Hill/Holmes
64,Section_1,David Holmes,"On July 25th, President Trump made a congratulatory phone phone call to President Zelensky after his party won a commanding majority in Ukraine’s parliamentary election. Contrary to standard procedure, the embassy received no readout of that call, and I was unaware of what was discussed until the transcript was released on September 25th. Upon reading the transcript, I was deeply disappointed to see that the President raised none of what I understood to be our inner agency agreed-upon foreign policy priorities in Ukraine and instead raised the Biden Burisma investigation and referred to the theory about CrowdStrike and its supposed connection to Ukraine in the 2016 election.",43:33,Hill/Holmes
65,Section_1,David Holmes,"The next day, July 26th, 2019, I attended meetings at the presidential administration building in Kiev with Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and Ambassador Sondland, and I took notes during those meetings. Our first meeting was with President Zelensky’s chief of staff. It was brief, as he had already been summoned by President Zelensky to prepare for a subsequent broader meeting. But he did say that President Trump had expressed interest during the previous day’s phone call and President Zelensky’s personnel decisions related to the Prosecutor General’s office.",44:13,Hill/Holmes
66,Section_1,David Holmes,"The delegation then met with President Zelensky and several other senior officials. During the meeting, President Zelensky stated that during the July 25th call, President Trump had “three times, raised some very sensitive issues” and that he would have to follow up. He, Zelensky, would have to follow up on those issues when he and President Trump met in person. Not having received a readout of the July 25th call, I did not know at the time what those sensitive issues were. After the meeting with President Zelensky, Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Taylor quickly left the presidential administration building for a trip to the front lines. Ambassador Sondland, who was to fly out that afternoon, stayed behind to have a meeting with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to President Zelensky.",44:45,Hill/Holmes
67,Section_1,David Holmes,"As I was leaving the meeting with President Zelensky, I was told to join the meeting with Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Yermak to take notes. I had not expected to join that meeting and it was a flight of stairs behind Ambassador Sondland as he headed to meet with Mr. Yermak. When I reached Mr. Yermak’s office, Ambassador Sondland had already gone into the meeting. I explained to Mr. Yermak’s assistant that I was supposed to join the meeting as the embassy’s representative and strongly urge her to let me in, but she told me that Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Yermak had insisted that the meeting be one-on-one with no note-taker.",45:29,Hill/Holmes
68,Section_1,David Holmes,"I then waited in the ante room until the meeting ended, along with a member of Ambassador Sondland’s staff and a member of the US embassy Kiev staff. When the meeting ended, the two staffers and I accompanied Ambassador Sondland out of the presidential administration building. Ambassador Sondland said that he wanted to go to lunch, and I told him that I’d be happy to join him and the two staffers for lunch if he wanted to brief me out on his meeting with Mr. Yermak or discuss other issues, and Ambassador Sondland said that I should join.",46:02,Hill/Holmes
69,Section_1,David Holmes,"The four of us went to a nearby restaurant and sat on an outdoor terrace. I sat directly across from Ambassador Sondland, and the two staffers sat off to our sides. At first, the lunch was largely social. Ambassador Sondland selected a bottle of wine that he shared among the four of us, and we discussed topics such as marketing strategies for his hotel business. During the lunch, Ambassador Sondland said that he was going to call President Trump to give him an update.",46:29,Hill/Holmes
70,Section_1,David Holmes,"Ambassador Sondland placed a call on his mobile phone, and I heard him announce himself several times along the lines of Gordon Sondland holding for the President. It appeared that he was being transferred through several layers of switchboards and assistance, and I then noticed Ambassador Sondland’s demeanor changed and understood that he had been connected to President Trump. While Ambassador Sondland’s phone was not on speaker phone, I could hear the president’s voice through the ear piece of the phone.",46:56,Hill/Holmes
71,Section_1,David Holmes,"The President’s voice was loud and recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume. I heard Ambassador Sondland greet the President and explained he was calling from Kiev. I heard President Trump then clarify that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in Ukraine and went on to state that President Zelensky “loves your ass.” I then heard President Trump ask, “So he’s going to do the investigation?”",47:23,Hill/Holmes
72,Section_1,David Holmes,"Ambassador Sondland replied that, “He’s going to do it,” adding that “President Zelensky will do anything you ask him to do.” Even though I did not take notes of these statements, I have a clear recollection.",47:52,Hill/Holmes
73,Section_1,David Holmes,"Even though I did not take notes of these statements, I have a clear recollection that these statements were made. I believe that my colleagues who were sitting at the table also knew that Ambassador Sondland was speaking with the president.",48:03,Hill/Holmes
74,Section_1,David Holmes,"The conversation then shifted to Ambassador Sondland’s efforts on behalf of the president to assist a rapper who was jailed in Sweden. I can only hear Ambassador Sondland’s side of the conversation. Ambassador Sondland told the president that the rapper was quote, “Kind of eff’d there and should have pled guilty.” He recommended that the president, “Wait until after the sentencing or it will only make it worse.” He added that the president should, “Let him get sentenced, play the racism card, give him a ticker tape when he comes home.” Ambassador Sondland further told the president that Sweden, “Should have released him on your word, but that you can tell the Kardashians you tried.”",48:13,Hill/Holmes
75,Section_1,David Holmes,"After the call ended, Ambassador Sondland remarked that the president was in a bad mood as Ambassador Sondland stated was often the case early in the morning. I then took the opportunity to ask Ambassador Sondland for his candid impression of the president’s views on Ukraine. In particular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if it was true that the president did not give a expletive about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland agreed that the president did not give an expletive about Ukraine.",48:54,Hill/Holmes
76,Section_1,David Holmes,"I asked, “Why not?” Ambassador Sondland stated that the president only cares about big stuff. I noted there was big stuff going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia. Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant big stuff that benefits the president like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing. The conversation then moved on to other topics.",49:20,Hill/Holmes
77,Section_1,David Holmes,"Upon returning to the embassy, I immediately briefed my direct supervisor, the deputy chief of mission about Ambassador Sondland’s call with President Trump and my subsequent conversation with Ambassador Sondland. I told others at the embassy about the call as well. I also emailed an embassy official in Sweden regarding the issue with the US rapper that was discussed on the call.",49:43,Hill/Holmes
78,Section_1,David Holmes,"July 26th was my last day in the office ahead of a long planned vacation that ended on August 6th. After returning to the embassy, I told Ambassador Taylor about the July 26th call. I also repeated repeatedly referred to the call and the conversation with Ambassador Sondland in meetings and conversations where the issue of the president’s interest in Ukraine was potentially relevant.",50:04,Hill/Holmes
79,Section_1,David Holmes,"At that time, Ambassador Sondland’s statement of the president’s lack of interest in Ukraine was of particular focus. We understood that in order to secure a meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky, we would have to work hard to find a way to explain Ukraine’s importance to President Trump in terms that he found compelling.",50:26,Hill/Holmes
80,Section_1,David Holmes,"Over the ensuing weeks, we continued to try to identify ways to frame the importance of Ukraine in ways that would appeal to the president, to determine how to lift the hold on security assistance and to move forward on the scheduling of the White House by President Zelensky.",50:47,Hill/Holmes
81,Section_1,David Holmes,"Ukrainian Independence Day, August 24th, presented another good opportunity to show support for Ukraine. Secretary Pompeo had considered attending as National Security Advisor Bolton had attended in 2018 and Defense Secretary Mattis had attended in 2017. But in the end, nobody senior to Ambassador Volker attended.",51:01,Hill/Holmes
82,Section_1,David Holmes,"Shortly thereafter on August 27th, Ambassador Bolton visited Ukraine and brought welcome news that President Trump had agreed to meet President Zelensky on September 1st in Warsaw. Ambassador Bolton further indicated that the hold on security assistance would not be lifted prior to the Warsaw meeting where it would hang on whether President Zelensky was able to “Favorably impress President Trump.”",51:21,Hill/Holmes
83,Section_1,David Holmes,"I took notes in Ambassador Bolton’s meetings that day with President Zelensky and his chief of staff. Ambassador Bolton told Zelensky’s chief of staff that the meeting between the president and Warsaw would be, “Crucial to cementing their relationship.” However, President Trump ultimately pulled out of the Warsaw trip, so the hold remained in place with no clear means to get it lifted.",51:45,Hill/Holmes
84,Section_1,David Holmes,"Between the meetings on August 27th, I heard Ambassador Bolton express to Ambassador Taylor and National Security Council Senior Director Tim Morrison his frustration about Mr. Giuliani’s influence with the president, making clear there was nothing he could do about it. He recommended that Mr. Lutsenko’s replacement as prosecutor general open a channel with his counterpart, Attorney General Barr, in place of the informal channel between Mr. Yermak and Mr. Giuliani. Ambassador Bolton also expressed frustration about Ambassador Sondland’s expansive interpretation of his mandate.",52:05,Hill/Holmes
85,Section_1,David Holmes,"After President Trump canceled his visit to Warsaw, we continued to try to appeal to the president in foreign policy and national security terms. To that end, Ambassador Taylor told me that Ambassador Bolton recommended that he, Ambassador Taylor, send a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo articulating the importance of the security assistance. At Ambassador Taylor’s direction, I drafted and transmitted the cable on Ambassador Taylor’s behalf on August 29th, which further attempted to explain the importance of Ukraine and the security assistance to US national security.",52:41,Hill/Holmes
86,Section_1,David Holmes,"By this point however, my clear impression was that the security assistance hold was likely intended by the president either as an expression of dissatisfaction with Ukrainians, who were not yet agreed to the Burisma-Biden investigation, or as an effort to increase the pressure on them to do so. On September 5th, I took notes at Senator Johnson and Senator Chris Murphy’s meetings with President Zelensky in Kyiv where president Zelensky asked about the security assistance. Although both senators stressed strong bipartisan congressional support for Ukraine, Senator Johnson cautioned President Zelensky that President Trump has a negative view of Ukraine and that President Zelensky would have a difficult time overcoming it.",53:13,Hill/Holmes
87,Section_1,David Holmes,"Senator Johnson further explained that he had been, “Shocked by President Trump’s negative reaction during an oval office meeting on May 23rd when he and the three amigos proposed that President Trump meet President Zelensky and show support for Ukraine.” On September 8th, Ambassador Taylor told me, “Now they’re insisting Zelensky commit to the investigation in an interview with CNN,” which I took to refer to this three amigos. I was shocked the requirement was so specific and concrete.",53:56,Hill/Holmes
88,Section_1,David Holmes,"While we had advised our Ukranian counterparts to voice a commitment to following the rule of law in generally investigating credible corruption allegations, this was a demand that President Zelensky personally commit on a cable news channel to a specific investigation of President Trump’s political rival.",54:25,Hill/Holmes
89,Section_1,David Holmes,"On September 11th, the hold was finally lifted after significant press coverage and bipartisan congressional expressions of concern about the withholding of security assistance. Although we knew the hold was lifted, we were still concerned that President Zelensky had committed in exchange for the lifting, to give the requested CNN interview. We had several indications that the interview would occur.",54:46,Hill/Holmes
90,Section_1,David Holmes,"First, the YES conference in Kyiv was held from September 12th to 14th and CNN’s Fareed Zakaria was one of the moderators. Second on September 13th, an embassy colleague received a phone call from another colleague who worked for Ambassador Sondland. My colleague texted me regarding that call, that, “Sondland said the Zelensky interview was supposed to be today or Monday. They plan to announce that a certain investigation that was on hold will progress.” Sondland’s aid did not know if this was decided or if Sondland was advocating for it. Apparently he’s been discussing this with Yermak.",55:07,Hill/Holmes
91,Section_1,David Holmes,"Finally also on September 13th, Ambassador Taylor and I ran into Mr. Yermak on our way out to a meeting with President Zelensky in his private office. Ambassador Taylor again stressed the importance of staying out of US politics and said he hoped no interview was planned. Mr. Yermak did not answer, but shrugged in resignation as if to indicate that he had no choice.",55:46,Hill/Holmes
92,Section_1,David Holmes,"In short, everybody thought there was going to be an interview and that the Ukrainians believed they had to do it. The interview ultimately did not occur. On September 21st, Ambassador Taylor and I collaborated on input he sent to Mr. Morrison to brief President Trump ahead of a September 25th meeting that had been scheduled with President Zelensky in New York on the margins of the UN General Assembly. The transcript of the July 25th call was released the same day. As of today, I have still not seen a readout of the September 25th meeting.",56:06,Hill/Holmes
93,Section_1,David Holmes,"As the impeachment inquiry has progressed, I’ve followed press reports and reviewed the statements of Ambassadors Taylor and Yovanovitch. Based on my experiences in Ukraine, my recollection is generally consistent with their testimony. I believe the relevant facts were therefore being laid out for the American people. However in the last couple of weeks, I read press reports expressing for the first time that certain senior officials may have been acting without the presence, knowledge or freelancing in their dealings with Ukraine. At the same time, I also read reports noting that the lack of first-hand evidence in the investigation and suggesting that the only evidence being elicited at the hearings was hearsay.",56:39,Hill/Holmes
94,Section_1,David Holmes,"I came to realize that I had first-hand knowledge regarding certain events on July 26 that had not otherwise been reported and that those events potentially bore on the question of whether the president did in fact have knowledge that those senior officials were using the levers of diplomatic power to influence the new Ukrainian president to announce the opening of a criminal investigation against President Trump’s political opponent. It is at that point that I made the observation to Ambassador Taylor that the incident I had witnessed on July 26th had acquired greater significance, which is what he reported in his testimony last week and is what led to the subpoena for me to appear here today.",57:20,Hill/Holmes
95,Section_1,David Holmes,"In conclusion, I’d like to take a moment to turn back to Ukraine. Today, this very day marks exactly six years since throngs of pro-Western Ukrainians spontaneously gathered on Kyiv’s Independence Square to launch what became known as the Revolution of Dignity. While the protest began in opposition to a turn towards Russia and away from the West, they expanded over three months to reject the entire corrupt repressive system that had been sustained by Russian influence in the country. Those events were followed by Russia’s occupation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and invasion of Ukraine’s Eastern Donbass region, and an ensuing war that to date has cost almost 14,000 lives.",58:03,Hill/Holmes
96,Section_1,David Holmes,"Despite the Russian aggression over the past five years, Ukrainians have rebuilt a shattered economy, adhered to a peace process and moved economically and socially closer to the West, toward our way of life. Earlier this year, large majorities of Ukrainians again chose a fresh start by voting for a political newcomer as president, replacing 80% of their parliament and endorsing a platform consistent with our democratic values, our foreign priorities and our strategic interests.",58:53,Hill/Holmes
97,Section_1,David Holmes,"This year’s revolution at the ballot box underscores that despite its imperfections, Ukraine is a genuine and vibrant democracy and an example to other post-Soviet countries and beyond from Moscow to Hong Kong. How we respond to this historic opportunity will set the trajectory of our relationship with Ukraine and will define our willingness to defend our bedrock international principles and our leadership role in the world.",59:27,Hill/Holmes
98,Section_1,David Holmes,"Ukrainians wants to hear a clear and unambiguous reaffirmation that our long-standing bipartisan policy of strong support for Ukraine remains unchanged and that we fully back it at the highest levels. Now is not the time to retreat from our relationship with Ukraine, but rather to double down on it. As we sit here today, Ukrainians are fighting a hot war on Ukrainian territory against Russian aggression. This week alone since I have been here in Washington, two Ukrainian soldiers were killed and two injured by Russian-led forces in Eastern Ukraine despite a declared ceasefire. I learned overnight that seven more were injured yesterday.",59:57,Hill/Holmes
99,Section_1,David Holmes,"As Vice President Pence said after his meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw, the US-Ukraine relationship has never been stronger. Ukrainians and their new government earnestly want to believe that. Ukrainians cherish their bipartisan American support that has sustained their Euro-Atlantic aspirations. They recoil at the thought of playing a role in US domestic politics or elections.",01:00:42,Hill/Holmes
100,Section_1,David Holmes,"At a time of shifting allegiances and rising competitors in the world, we have no better friends than Ukraine, a scrappy, unbowed, determined and above all dignified people who are standing up against Russian authoritarianism and aggression. They deserve better. We’re now at an inflection point in Ukraine and it is critical to our national security that we stand in strong support of our Ukrainian partners. Ukrainians and freedom loving people everywhere are watching the example we set here of democracy and the rule of law. Thank you.",01:01:08,Hill/Holmes

I have a short opening statement. I appreciate the importance of Congress’s impeachment inquiry. I’m appearing today as a fact witness as I did during my deposition on October 14th in order to answer your questions about what I saw, what I did, what I knew and what I know with regard to the subjects of your inquiry.",01:02:04,Hill/Holmes
107,Section_1,Fiona Hill,I believe that those who have information that the Congress deems relevant have a legal and a moral obligation to provide it. I take great pride in the fact that I’m a nonpartisan foreign policy expert who was served under three Republican and Democratic presidents. I have no interest in advancing the outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction except toward the truth. I will not provide a long narrative statement because I believe that the interest of Congress and the American people is best served by allowing you to ask me your questions. I’m happy to expand upon my October 14th deposition testimony and respond to your questions today.,01:02:33,Hill/Holmes
108,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"But before I do so, I’d like to communicate two things. First, I’d like to show a little bit about who I am. I’m an American by choice having become a citizen in 2002. I was born in the Northeast of England in the same region that George Washington’s ancestors came from. Both my region and my family have deep ties to the United States. My paternal grandfather fought through World War I in the Royal Field Artillery surviving being shot, shelled and gassed before American troops intervened to end the war in 1918.",01:03:13,Hill/Holmes
109,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"During the second World War, other members of my family fought to defend the free world from fascism alongside American soldiers, sailors and airmen. The men in my father’s family were coal miners whose family has always struggled with poverty. When my father Alfred was 14, he joined his father, brothers, brother, uncles and cousins in the coal mines to help put food on the table. When the last of the local mines closed in the 1960s, my father wanted to emigrate to the United States to work in the coal mines in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. But his mother, my grandmother, had been crippled from hard labor and my father couldn’t leave. He stayed in Northern England until he died in 2012. My mother still lives in my hometown today.",01:03:47,Hill/Holmes
110,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"While his dream of emigrating to America was thwarted, my father loved America, its culture, its history, and its role as a beacon of hope for the world. He always wanted someone in the family to make it to the United States. I began my university studies in 1984. I just learned that I went to the same university as my colleague here, Mr. Holmes in St. Andrews in Scotland. Just thought I would add that. In 1987, I won a place on an academic exchange to the Soviet Union. I was there for the signing of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces INF Treaty and when president Ronald Reagan met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow.",01:04:32,Hill/Holmes
111,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"This was a turning point for me. An American professor who I met there told me about graduate students scholarships to the United States. The very next year thanks to his advice, I arrived in America to start my advanced studies at Harvard. Years later, I can say with confidence that this country has offered me opportunities I never would have had in England. I grew up poor with a very distinctive working class accent. In England in the 1980s and 1990s, this would have impeded my professional advancement. This background has never sent me back in America.",01:05:07,Hill/Holmes
112,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"For the best part of three decades, I’ve built a career as a nonpartisan, nonpolitical, national security professional focusing on Europe and Eurasia and especially the former Soviet Union. I’ve served our country under three presidents. My most recent capacity under President Trump, as well as in my former position as national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. In that role, I was the intelligence community senior expert on Russia and the former Soviet Republics including Ukraine.",01:05:38,Hill/Holmes
113,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"It was because of my background and experience that I was asked to join the National Security Council in 2017. At the NSC, Russia was part of my portfolio, but I was also responsible for coordinating US policy for all of Western Europe, all of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine and Turkey, along with NATO and the European Union. I was hired initially by General Michael Flynn, K.T. McFarland and General Keith Kellogg. But then I started working April 2017 when General McMaster was the national security advisor.",01:06:11,Hill/Holmes
114,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I, and they, thought that I could help them with President Trump’s stated goal of improving relations with Russia while still implementing policies designed to deter Russian conduct that threatens the United States, including the unprecedented and successful Russian operation to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. This relates to the second thing I want to communicate.",01:06:43,Hill/Holmes
115,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its Security Services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps, somehow for some reason, Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian Security Services themselves. The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports. It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details must remain classified.",01:07:04,Hill/Holmes
116,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"The impacts of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remains evident today. Our nation is being turned apart. Truth is questioned. Our highly professional and expert career Foreign Service is being undermined. US support for Ukraine, which continues to face armed Russian aggression has been politicized. The Russian government’s goal is to weaken our country, to diminish America’s global role and to neutralize a perceived US threat to Russian interests. President Putin and the Russian Security Services aim to counter US foreign policy objectives in Europe, including in Ukraine, where Moscow wishes to reassert political economic dominance.",01:07:45,Hill/Holmes
117,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I say this not as an alarmist, but as a realist. I do not think long-term conflict with Russia is either desirable or inevitable. I continue to believe that we need to seek ways of stabilizing our relationship with Moscow even as we come to their efforts to harm us. Right now, Russia’s Security Services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We’re running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interest.",01:08:24,Hill/Holmes
118,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"As Republicans and Democrats have agreed for decades, Ukraine is a valued partner of the United States. It plays an important role in our national security. As I told the committee last month, I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a US adversary and that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked us in 2016. These fictions are harmful even if they’re deployed for purely domestic political purposes.",01:08:57,Hill/Holmes
119,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"President Putin and the Russian Security Services operate like a super PAC. They deploy millions of dollars to weaponize our own political opposition research and false narratives. When we are consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each other, degrade our institutions, and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy.",01:09:22,Hill/Holmes
120,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I respect the work that this Congress does in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities, including this inquiry. I’m here to help you to the best of my ability. If the president or anyone else impedes or subverts the national security of the United States in order to further domestic, political, or personal interests, that’s more than worthy of your attention. But we must not let domestic politics stop us from defending ourselves against the foreign powers who truly wish us harm.",01:09:47,Hill/Holmes
121,Section_1,Fiona Hill,I’m ready to answer your questions. Thank you.,01:10:14,Hill/Holmes
122,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Thank you, Dr. Hill. I will now proceed to the first round of questions. As detailed in the memo provided the Committee members, there’ll be 45 minutes of questions conducted by the Chairman or Majority Counsel, followed by 45 minutes for the ranking member or Minority Counsel. Following that, unless I specify additional equal time for extended questioning, we will proceed under the five minute rule and every member will have a chance to ask questions. I now recognize myself or Majority Counsel for the first round of questions.",00:01,Hill/Holmes
123,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"First of all, thank you both for being here. Thank you for testifying. Dr. Hill, your story reminds me a great deal of what we heard from Alexander Vindman. The few immigrant stories that we’ve heard just in the course of these hearings are among the most powerful I think I’ve ever heard. You and Colonel Vindman and others are the best of this country, and you came here by choice, and we are so blessed that you did. So, welcome.",00:28,Hill/Holmes
124,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"My colleagues took some umbrage with your opening statement, but I think the American people can be forgiven if they have the same impression listening to some of the statements of my colleagues during this hearing; that Russia didn’t intervene in our election, it was all the Ukrainians. There’s an effort to take a tweet here, and an op-ed there, and a newspaper story here, and somehow equate it with the systemic intervention that our intelligence agencies found that Russia perpetrated in 2016 through an extensive social media campaign, and a hacking and dumping operation. Indeed, the report my colleagues gave you that they produced during the investigation calls into question the accuracy of the Intelligence Committee’s finding that Russia intervened to help one side, to help Donald Trump at the expense of Hillary Clinton. No one in the Intelligence community questions that finding, nor does the FBI, nor does the Senate bipartisan Intelligence Committee report, nor does the Minority Committee report of this Committee. The house Republican report is an outlier.",01:07,Hill/Holmes
125,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"But let me ask you, Dr. Hill, about your concern with that Russian narrative; that it wasn’t the Russians that engaged in interfering in our election in 2016; and of course this was given a boost when President Trump in Helsinki, in the presence of Putin, said that he questioned his own intelligence agencies. But why are the Russians pushing that narrative, that it was Ukraine? How does that serve Russian interests?",02:09,Hill/Holmes
126,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"The Russians’ interests, frankly, to de-legitimized our entire Presidency. So I want an issue that I do want to raise, and I think that this would resonate with our colleagues on the Committee from the Republican party, is that the goal of the Russians was really to put whoever became the President by trying to tip their hands on one side of the scale under a cloud. So if Secretary, former First Lady, former Senator Clinton, had been elected as President, as indeed many expected in the run up to the election in 2016, she, too would have had major questions about her legitimacy. And I think that what we’re seeing here as a result of all of these narratives is this is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for. If they seed misinformation, they see doubt. They have everybody questioning the legitimacy of a Presidential candidate, be it President Trump or potentially a President Clinton; that they would pit one side of our electorate against the other; that they would pit one party against the other.",02:36,Hill/Holmes
127,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"And that’s why I wanted to make such a strong point at the very beginning, because there was certainly individuals in many other countries who had harsh words for both of the candidates; who had harsh words for many of the candidates during the primaries. We had a lot of people who were running for President on the Republican side. There were many people who are trying themselves to game the outcome. As you know, in the United Kingdom, the bookies take bets. You can go to Logbrooks or William Hill and lay a bet on who you think is going to be the candidate. So the Russian government were trying to land their own bets, but what they wanted to do was give a spread. They wanted to make sure that whoever they had bet on or whoever they’d tried to tip the scales, would also experience some discomfort; that they were beholden to them in some way; that they would create just the kind of chaos that we have seen in our politics. So I just want to again emphasize that we need to be very careful as we discuss all of these issues, not to give them more fodder that they can use against us in 2020.",03:42,Hill/Holmes
128,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And I quite agree. There’s an additional benefit, and I think you’re absolutely right, the Russians are equal opportunity meddlers. They will not only help one side, but they’ll also just seek to sow discord in the United States along ethnic lines, religious lines, geographic lines. But there’s also a benefit now, isn’t there, for Russia to put the blame on Ukraine; to cast doubt on whether they intervened at all in our election and blame it on a U.S.ally as a way of driving a wedge between the U.S. and Ukraine? Isn’t that true?",04:40,Hill/Holmes
129,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Well, that’s absolutely the case, and in fact you just made the point about U.S. allies. The Russians like to put a lot of blame on U.S. allies for incidents that they have perpetrated. We saw that recently with the United Kingdom in the Russian secret services attack on a former spy, Mr. Scripholland, his daughter in Salisbury in England. Well, you may recall that the Russians actually accused the British government of perpetrating this themselves. So this falls into a long pattern of deflection, and of the Russian government trying to pin the blame on someone else. And as my colleague, Mr. Holmes, here has laid out, the Russians have a particular vested interest in putting Ukraine and Ukrainians and Ukrainian leaders in a very bad light.",05:12,Hill/Holmes
130,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"All of the issues that we started to discuss today, and that you on the Committee have been deeply involved in, began with Russia’s illegal annexation of the peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014; in response in 2015, and all of the different acts of aggression that Russia’s engaged in since starting a war in the Donbas; shooting down Russian operatives, a plane MH-17 over the Donbas at a later period. There is a great deal of hostility and malign intent towards the Ukraine, and it suits the Russian government very much if we are also looking at Ukraine as somehow a perpetrator of malign acts against us.",05:52,Hill/Holmes
131,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Thank you. Mr. Holmes, I want to ask you a quick couple of questions, and I think as often is the case for people … You know, I was obviously at your deposition, I’ve read your opening testimony; but as you learn more facts, you start to see things in different light, even though your opening statement is very much consistent with your opening statement during the deposition. And I was struck in particular by something you said on page 10 of your opening statement. “While we had advised our Ukrainian counterparts to voice a commitment to following the rule of law and generally investigating credible corruption allegations, this was a demand that President Zelensky personally commit on a cable news channel to a specific investigation of President Trump’s political rival.”",06:33,Hill/Holmes
132,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"This gets to a point I made at the close of our hearing yesterday about hypocrisy. Here we are, and we are urging Ukrainians to commit to following the rule of law as you said, and only investigate genuine and credible allegations. And what are we doing? We’re asking them to investigate the President’s political rival. Ukrainians are pretty sophisticated actors, aren’t they? They can recognize hypocrisy when they see it. What does that do to our anti-corruption efforts when the Ukrainians perceive that we’re engaging in corruption ourselves?",07:18,Hill/Holmes
133,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes sir. So our long standing policy is to encourage them to establish and build a rule of law institutions that are capable, and they’re independent, and that can actually pursue credible allegations. That’s our policy and we’ve been doing that for quite some time with some success. So focusing on particular cases, including particular cases where there is an interest of the President’s, is just not part of what we’ve done. It’s hard to explain why we would do that.",07:57,Hill/Holmes
134,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"And it hearkens back to that conversation Ambassador Volker testified about when he urged Ukraine not to investigate or prosecute Poroschenko, and the reply from Mr. Yermack was, “Oh, you mean like you want us to do with the Bidens and the Clintons?” They’re sophisticated enough actors to recognize when we’re saying ‘do as we say, not as we do,’ are they not?",08:25,Hill/Holmes
135,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir.",08:48,Hill/Holmes
136,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"You also in your testimony, and I was struck by this anew today, when even after the aid is lifted, Ukraine still felt pressured to make these statements, and you and Ambassador Taylor were worried that they were going to do it on CNN. And you said that, “Ambassador Taylor again stressed the importance of staying out of U.S. politics, and said he hoped no interviews, no interview was planned. Mr. Yermack did not answer, but shrugged in resignation as if to indicate that they had no choice. In short, everyone thought there was going to be an interview and that the Ukrainians believed they had to do it.” So you’re acknowledging, I think Mr. Holmes, are you not that Ukraine very much felt pressured to undertake these investigations that the President, Rudy Giuliani, and Ambassador Sondland and others were demanding?",08:50,Hill/Holmes
137,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir. And although the hold on the security assistance may have been lifted, there were still things they wanted that they weren’t getting, including a meeting with the President in the Oval Office. Whether the hold, the security assistance hold continued or not, the Ukrainians understood that that’s something the President wanted and they still wanted important things from the President. So, and I think that continues to this day. I think they’re being very careful. They still need us now going forward.",09:45,Hill/Holmes
138,Section_1,David Holmes,"In fact, right now President Zelensky is trying to arrange a summit meeting with President Putin in the coming weeks; his first face-to-face meeting with him to try to advance the peace process. He needs our support. He needs President Putin to understand that America supports Zelensky at the highest levels. So this is, this doesn’t end with the lifting of the security assistance hold. Ukraine still needs us, and as I said, still fighting this war this very day.",10:09,Hill/Holmes
139,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"Well, and I would underscore again as my colleague did so eloquently, they got caught. That’s the reason the aid was finally lifted. Mr Goldman.",10:35,Hill/Holmes
140,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to both of you. Yesterday we heard testimony from Ambassador Gordon Sondland from the European Union, who testified that President Trump wanted Ukraine to announce the investigations into Biden, the Bidens of Barisma and the 2016 elections because they would benefit him politically, and that he used the leverage of that White House meeting and the security assistance to pressure President Zelensky to do so. Dr. Hill, you testified I believe that in mid-June Ambassador Sondland told you that he was in charge of Ukraine policy. Is that right?",10:45,Hill/Holmes
141,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"That’s correct, sir. Yes.",11:22,Hill/Holmes
142,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Who did he tell you had put him in charge of Ukraine policy?,11:23,Hill/Holmes
143,Section_1,Fiona Hill,He told me it was the President.,11:28,Hill/Holmes
144,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Mr. Holmes, did you also understand that Ambassador Sondland had been given some authority over Ukraine policy from the President?",11:30,Hill/Holmes
145,Section_1,David Holmes,We understood that he had been told to work with Mr. Giuliani.,11:40,Hill/Holmes
146,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,And did he hold himself out as having direct contact and knowledge of the President’s priorities and interests?,11:45,Hill/Holmes
147,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir.",11:53,Hill/Holmes
148,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now Mr. Holmes, I’m going to go to that July 26th date when you overheard the conversation between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump, and I’m going to ask you a little bit about the lead up to that conversation. Before the lunch that you described, you said that you accompanied Ambassadors Sondland, Volker, and Taylor to a meeting with President Zelensky. Is that right?",11:55,Hill/Holmes
149,Section_1,David Holmes,That’s correct.,12:22,Hill/Holmes
150,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,And you took notes at that meeting?,12:24,Hill/Holmes
151,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir.",12:25,Hill/Holmes
152,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,And you reviewed those notes before you came here to testify today?,12:26,Hill/Holmes
153,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,12:30,Hill/Holmes
154,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And they were helpful to refresh your recollection as to what happened, is that right?",12:30,Hill/Holmes
155,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,12:34,Hill/Holmes
156,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"During that meeting, President Zelensky said that on his phone call with President Trump the previous day, that three times President Trump had mentioned ‘sensitive issues.’ Did you understand what President Zelensky was referring to when he said the ‘sensitive issues?’",12:35,Hill/Holmes
157,Section_1,David Holmes,"I couldn’t be sure what he was referring to until I later read the transcript of the July 25th call, but I was aware of various contacts between the Three Amigos and his government about this set of issues.",12:55,Hill/Holmes
158,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And after you read the call, what did you determine to be the sensitive issues that President Zelensky referenced?",13:09,Hill/Holmes
159,Section_1,David Holmes,The Barisma-Biden investigation.,13:14,Hill/Holmes
160,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"After this meeting with President Zelensky, you testified that Ambassador Sondland had a one-on-one meeting with Andre Yermack, a top aide to Zelensky, and that you were prohibited from going into that meeting to take notes. Is that right?",13:16,Hill/Holmes
161,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,13:30,Hill/Holmes
162,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And yesterday, Ambassador Sondland testified that he probably discussed the investigations with Mr. Yermack. Did Ambassador Sondland tell you at all what they discussed?",13:32,Hill/Holmes
163,Section_1,David Holmes,He did not.,13:43,Hill/Holmes
164,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now after this meeting with Mr. Yermack, you went to lunch; and can you just describe where you were sitting at the restaurant?",13:45,Hill/Holmes
165,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir. The restaurant has sort of glass doors that open onto a terrace, and we were at the first tables on the terrace; so immediately outside of the interior of the restaurant. The doors were all wide open. There were, there was tables, a table for four, although I recall it being two tables for two pushed together. In any case, it was quite a wide table, and the table was set with sort of a table runner down in the middle. I was directly across from Ambassador Sondland. We were close enough that we could, you know, share an appetizer between us. And then the two staffers were off to our right at this next table.",13:53,Hill/Holmes
166,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now you said that at some point Ambassador Sondland pulled out his cell phone and called President Trump. This was an unsecure cell phone, is that right?",14:33,Hill/Holmes
167,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir.",14:44,Hill/Holmes
168,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,In the middle of a restaurant in Kiev?,14:45,Hill/Holmes
169,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,14:47,Hill/Holmes
170,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Now you said that you were able to hear President Trump’s voice through the receiver. How were you able to hear if it was not on speaker phone?,14:49,Hill/Holmes
171,Section_1,David Holmes,"It was, there’s several things. It was quite loud when the President came on, quite distinctive. I believe Ambassador Sondland also said yesterday he often speaks very loudly over the phone, and I certainly experienced that. When the President came on, he sort of winced and held the phone away from his ear like this, and he did that for the first couple exchanges. I don’t know if he then turned the volume down, if he got used to it, if the President moderated his volume. I don’t know, but that’s how I was able to hear it.",15:01,Hill/Holmes
172,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And so you were able to hear some of what President Trump said to President Zelensky, is that right?",15:31,Hill/Holmes
173,Section_1,David Holmes,"The first portion of the conversation, yes.",15:38,Hill/Holmes
174,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And what did you hear President Trump say to … I’m sorry, not President Zelensky, to Ambassador Sondland?",15:39,Hill/Holmes
175,Section_1,David Holmes,What did I hear the-,15:47,Hill/Holmes
176,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,The President say to Ambassador Sondland?,15:47,Hill/Holmes
177,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yeah, he clarified whether he was in Ukraine or not, and he said yes, I’m here in Ukraine. And then Ambassador Sondland said, said “He loves your ass. He’ll do anything you want.” He said, “Is he going to do the investigation?”",15:50,Hill/Holmes
178,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,So you heard President Trump,16:02,Hill/Holmes
179,Section_1,David Holmes,"… He said, “Is he going to do the investigation?”",16:03,Hill/Holmes
180,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"So you heard President Trump ask Ambassador Sondland, “Is he going to do the investigation?”",16:03,Hill/Holmes
181,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir.",16:08,Hill/Holmes
182,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,What was Ambassador Sondland’s response?,16:11,Hill/Holmes
183,Section_1,David Holmes,"He said, “Oh, yeah. He’s going to do it. He’ll do anything you ask.”",16:14,Hill/Holmes
184,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,And was that the end of the Ukraine portion of the conversation?,16:20,Hill/Holmes
185,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,16:24,Hill/Holmes
186,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Afterwards, you described a follow on conversation that you had with Ambassador Sondland where you asked him, I think, generally what did President Trump think of Ukraine. Is that right?",16:26,Hill/Holmes
187,Section_1,David Holmes,Correct.,16:38,Hill/Holmes
188,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,What did Ambassador Sondland say to you?,16:39,Hill/Holmes
189,Section_1,David Holmes,He said he doesn’t really care about Ukraine.,16:42,Hill/Holmes
190,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Did he use slightly more colorful language than that?,16:44,Hill/Holmes
191,Section_1,David Holmes,He did.,16:47,Hill/Holmes
192,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,What did he say that he does care about?,16:48,Hill/Holmes
193,Section_1,David Holmes,He said he cares about big stuff.,16:50,Hill/Holmes
194,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Did he explain what he meant by “big stuff?”,16:52,Hill/Holmes
195,Section_1,David Holmes,"I asked him, “What kind of big stuff? We have big stuff going on here, like a war with Russia,” and he said, “No, big stuff like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani is pushing.”",16:55,Hill/Holmes
196,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, were you familiar with the Biden investigation that he referenced at that point?",17:07,Hill/Holmes
197,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir.",17:15,Hill/Holmes
198,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,And how do you have such a specific and clear recollection of this conversation with the President and your conversation with Ambassador Sondland.,17:18,Hill/Holmes
199,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yeah. So this was a very distinctive experience. I’ve never seen anything like this in my foreign service career. Someone at a lunch in a restaurant making a call on a cell phone to the President of the United States. Being able to hear his voice, his very distinctive personality, as we’ve all seen on television. Very colorful language was used. They were directly addressing something that I had been wondering about working on for weeks and even months. A topic that had led to the recall of my former boss, the former Ambassador. And so here was a person who said he had direct contact with the President, and had said that over the course of time. Here he is actually having that contact with the President, hearing the President’s voice, and them talking about this issue of the Biden investigation that I had been hearing about.",17:30,Hill/Holmes
200,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"So just to summarize, during the phone call that you overheard Ambassador Sondland have with President Trump, you heard President Trump himself ask the only question you really heard him ask, I believe, is whether he was going to do the investigation, to which Ambassador Sondland responded that he would, and he would, in fact, do anything that President Zelensky wants. Is that an accurate recitation of what happened?",18:28,Hill/Holmes
201,Section_1,David Holmes,That’s correct.,18:57,Hill/Holmes
202,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And then after that call, you had a subsequent conversation with Ambassador Sondland where he, in sum and substance, told you that the President doesn’t care about Ukraine, he only cares about big stuff related to himself, and particularly the Biden investigation that Giuliani was pushing?",18:59,Hill/Holmes
203,Section_1,David Holmes,Correct.,19:15,Hill/Holmes
204,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, a day before your lunch with Ambassador Sondland, President Trump did speak with President Zelensky, as you referred, and certainly the President made it clear to President Zelensky that he cared about the Biden investments. Now, neither of you did listen to this call, but as you testified, you both read it subsequent to its publication.",19:18,Hill/Holmes
205,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Dr. Hill, you, during your time, two and a half years in the White House, listened to a number of presidential phone calls. Is that right?",19:42,Hill/Holmes
206,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That’s right.,19:50,Hill/Holmes
207,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Can you estimate approximately how many?,19:51,Hill/Holmes
208,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I can’t actually. Sometimes there would be multiple calls during a week. I was there for more than two years, so it’s a fair number.",19:53,Hill/Holmes
209,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Have you ever heard a call like this one that you read?,20:01,Hill/Holmes
210,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I don’t want to comment on this call because this is, in my view, executive privilege. In terms of the testimony … Yes.",20:05,Hill/Holmes
211,Section_1,Speaker 1,"Yeah, I think that as a threshold matter, I think that there are issues of classification regarding head of state communications that we do want to be sensitive to in this forum, among other issues.",20:14,Hill/Holmes
212,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Understood. I’m really just focused on this one call that has been declassified and published, and just asking you whether you’d ever heard any presidential phone call along these lines.",20:26,Hill/Holmes
213,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Well, again, I’d like to just focus in this testimony on this particular call, and I will just say that I found this particular call subject matter and the way that it was conducted surprising.",20:36,Hill/Holmes
214,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,You said in your deposition testimony that you were very shocked and very saddened to read it.,20:50,Hill/Holmes
215,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That’s correct.,20:54,Hill/Holmes
216,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Why was that?,20:55,Hill/Holmes
217,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Because of the nature of the discussion, the juxtaposition of the issues in which they were raised, and also given the fact that I, myself, had actually imposed, along with Ambassador Bolton for some period, having a call unless it was very well prepared, and we were confident that the issues that Ukraine and the United States were most generally together interested in were going to be raised. And I saw in this call that this was not the case.",20:56,Hill/Holmes
218,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,You also testified that you were concerned that this call was turning a White House meeting into some kind of asset. Do you recall that testimony?,21:25,Hill/Holmes
219,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I don’t think it was specifically about that call, but I recall the testimony because this was clearly the discussion preceding the call. Remember, I left on July 19th, and the call took place the following week. In the months leading up to that, from May onwards, it became very clear that the White House meeting itself was being predicated on other issues, namely investigations and the questions about the election interference in 2016.",21:38,Hill/Holmes
220,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Mr. Holmes, you indicate in your opening statement that the Chief of Staff to President Zelensky had indicated to you that in this phone call on July 25th, there was a discussion about personnel issues related to the Prosecutor General’s office. After you read the call, did you understand who and what that was referring to?",22:06,Hill/Holmes
221,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir. In that brief meeting with the Chief of Staff, it was very confusing to me why, in only the few minutes we had, that would’ve been the issue he raised. So it wasn’t until I read the transcript of the call on the 25th that I understood that the President had specifically mentioned Prosecutor General Lutsenko, who the Zelensky administration was in the process of replacing and carving out all his underlings who had been collaborating with him on some of the corruption we saw there.",22:30,Hill/Holmes
222,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And I believe you also said that President Lutsenko was the source of some of Mr. Giuliani’s public views and allegations, is that right?",23:00,Hill/Holmes
223,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir. About two weeks before the press wave that we saw targeting Ambassador Yovanovitch became public, an embassy contact had reported to us privately that Mr. Lutsenko was sending these messages, and had met with an American journalist to try to get those messages out.",23:09,Hill/Holmes
224,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"What was the US embassy, in Ukraine’s view, of Prosecutor General Lutsenko?",23:31,Hill/Holmes
225,Section_1,David Holmes,"He was not a good partner. He had failed to deliver on the promised reforms that he had committed to when he took office, and he was using his office to insulate and protect political allies while presumably enriching himself.",23:39,Hill/Holmes
226,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Is another way to describe that “corrupt?”,24:00,Hill/Holmes
227,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,24:02,Hill/Holmes
228,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, I’m going to take a look at a couple of excerpts from this July 25th call with you, and the first one occurs right after President Zelensky thanked President Trump for the United States’ support in the area of defense. And President Trump immediately then says, “I would like you to do us a favor though, because our country has been through a lot, and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people, the server, they say Ukraine has it.”",24:04,Hill/Holmes
229,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, Dr. Hill, is this a reference to this debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine interference in the 2016 election that you discussed in your opening statement as well as with Chairman Schiff?",24:39,Hill/Holmes
230,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"The reference to Crowdstrike and the server, yes, that’s correct.",24:54,Hill/Holmes
231,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And it is your understanding that there is no basis for these allegations, is that correct?",24:57,Hill/Holmes
232,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That’s correct.,25:04,Hill/Holmes
233,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, isn’t it also true that some of President Trump’s most senior advisors had informed him that this theory of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election was false?",25:06,Hill/Holmes
234,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That’s correct.,25:18,Hill/Holmes
235,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"So is it your understanding then that President Trump disregarded the advice of his senior officials about this theory, and instead listened to Rudy Giuliani’s views?",25:20,Hill/Holmes
236,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"That appears to be the case, yes.",25:30,Hill/Holmes
237,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And I also then want to just show one other exhibit that goes back to what you were testifying earlier, Dr. Hill, about Russia’s interest in promoting this theory. This is an excerpt from a February 2nd, 2017, news conference with President Putin and Prime Minister Orban of Hungary, where Putin says, “Second, as we all know, during the presidential campaign in the United States, the Ukrainian government adopted a unilateral position in favor of one candidate. More than that, certain oligarchs, certainly with the approval of the political leadership, funded this candidate, or female candidate, to be more precise.”",25:35,Hill/Holmes
238,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Mr. Holmes, you spent three years as well in the US embassy in Russia. Why would it be to Vladimir Putin’s advantage to promote this theory of Ukraine interference?",26:17,Hill/Holmes
239,Section_1,David Holmes,"First of all, to deflect from the allegations of Russian interference. Second of all, to drive a wedge between the United States and Ukraine, which Russia wants to essentially get back into its sphere of influence. Thirdly, to besmirch Ukraine and its political leadership, to degrade and erode support for Ukraine from other key partners in Europe and elsewhere.",26:27,Hill/Holmes
240,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And, Dr. Hill, by promoting this theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, was President Trump adopting Vladimir Putin’s view over his own senior advisors and intelligence officials?",26:49,Hill/Holmes
241,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I think we have to be very careful about the way that we phrase that. This is a view that President Putin and the Russian Security Services and many [inaudible 00:27:13] in Russia have promoted, but I think that this view has also got some traction, perhaps in parallel and separately here in the United States, and those two things have, over time, started to fuse together.",27:03,Hill/Holmes
242,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Well, back in May of this year, do you recall that President Trump had a phone conversation in early May with President Putin?",27:28,Hill/Holmes
243,Section_1,Fiona Hill,I do.,27:38,Hill/Holmes
244,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And that he also then met in mid May with Prime Minister Orban, who had joined President Putin at this press conference?",27:39,Hill/Holmes
245,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That’s correct.,27:45,Hill/Holmes
246,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, that happened in between the time when President Zelensky was elected on April 21st and his inauguration on May 20th, is that right?",27:46,Hill/Holmes
247,Section_1,Fiona Hill,Correct.,28:00,Hill/Holmes
248,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And in fact, isn’t it true that President Trump had asked Vice President Pence to attend the inauguration after his phone call with President Zelensky on April 21st?",28:01,Hill/Holmes
249,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I’m not sure that I can say that President Trump had asked the Vice President Pence. I was not in any meeting in which that took place. I can say that I, myself, and many others at the NSC and in the State Department were quite keen, very eager to have Vice President Pence go to Ukraine to represent the United States government and the President.",28:14,Hill/Holmes
250,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And is that also your recollection, Mr. Holmes, that you wanted Vice President Pence to attend?",28:35,Hill/Holmes
251,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir, and we understood that that was the plan.",28:39,Hill/Holmes
252,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, Jennifer Williams from the Office of the Vice President testified here that on May 13th, which is the same day that President Trump met with Prime Minister Orban, that the President called off Vice President Pence’s trip for unknown reasons, but before the inauguration date had been scheduled. And, Dr. Hill, were you aware also that during that period, there was a lot of publicity, and I think, Mr. Holmes, you referenced this in your opening statement as well, about Rudy Giuliani’s interest in these investigations in Ukraine?",28:43,Hill/Holmes
253,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I was certainly aware, yes.",29:23,Hill/Holmes
254,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And around this time, Dr. Hill, you also, I believe, testified that Ambassador Bolton had expressed some views to you about Mr. Giuliani’s interest in Ukraine. Do you recall what you said?",29:26,Hill/Holmes
255,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That’s correct. Yes.,29:46,Hill/Holmes
256,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"What he said to you, rather?",29:47,Hill/Holmes
257,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I do recall, yes. It was part of a conversation about the things that Mr. Giuliani was saying very frequently in public. We saw him often on television making these statements, and I had already brought to Ambassador Bolton’s attention the attacks, the smear campaign against Ambassador Yovanovitch, and expressed great regret about how this was unfolding. And, in fact, the shameful way in which Ambassador Yovanovitch was being smeared and attacked, and I’d asked if there was anything that we could do about it. And Ambassador Bolton had looked pained, basically indicated with body language that there was nothing much that we could do about it, and he then, in the course of that discussion, said that Rudy Giuliani was a hand grenade that was going to blow everyone up.",29:49,Hill/Holmes
258,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Did you understand what he meant by that?,30:40,Hill/Holmes
259,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I did, actually.",30:42,Hill/Holmes
260,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,What did he mean?,30:43,Hill/Holmes
261,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Well, I think that he meant that obviously what Mr. Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive in any case. He was frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks about everyone involved in this, and that he was clearly pushing forward issues and ideas that would probably come back to haunt us. And in fact, I think that that’s where we are today.",30:44,Hill/Holmes
262,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, Mr. Holmes, did the Ukrainians understand that Rudy Giuliani represented the President’s views?",31:04,Hill/Holmes
263,Section_1,David Holmes,"I believe they did. First, he was reaching out to them directly. Ambassador Yovanovitch’s removal, I think, is relevant to this portion of the inquiry because she was removed following this media campaign in which Rudy Giuliani and his associates were very prominent, and criticizing her for not taking seriously some of the theories and issues that later came up. And so when she was removed, commentators in Ukraine believed that Lutsenko, working with Giuliani, had succeeded in getting her removed.",31:12,Hill/Holmes
264,Section_1,David Holmes,"So they were already aware of Mr. Giuliani and his influence, the issues that he was promoting, and, ultimately, that he was able to get an Ambassador removed partly because of that. So he was-",31:50,Hill/Holmes
265,Section_1,David Holmes,"… ambassador removed, partly because of that, so he was someone to contend with. Then in addition, immediately after the inauguration, he began reaching out to this Zelensky administration, key figures in the Zelensky administration, and continue to do that.",32:03,Hill/Holmes
266,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Let’s focus on the inauguration for a minute. You had escorted, for lack of a better word, the US delegation around?",32:16,Hill/Holmes
267,Section_1,David Holmes,"I joined them in in some of their meetings, but not for the entire day.",32:25,Hill/Holmes
268,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Who was on the official delegation?,32:29,Hill/Holmes
269,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir. It was five people. It was: The head of the delegation was Secretary Perry, and then it was Ambassador Volker representing the State Department, Ambassador Sondland, our temporary [sharjay 00:32:43], Joseph Pennington and Alex Vindman representing the White House.",32:32,Hill/Holmes
270,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Did the delegation have a meeting with President Zelensky that you attended?,32:48,Hill/Holmes
271,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,32:51,Hill/Holmes
272,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,You testified previously that Secretary Perry gave a list of some sort to President Zelensky at that meeting. Do you recall that?,32:53,Hill/Holmes
273,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes. In the meeting with the president, Secretary Perry as the head of the delegation opened the meeting for the American side and had a number of points he made, and during that period he handed over a piece of paper. I did not see what was on the paper, but Secretary Perry described what was on the paper as a list of trusted individuals and recommended that President Zelensky could draw from that list for advice on energy sector reform issues.",33:03,Hill/Holmes
274,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Do you know who was on that list?,33:33,Hill/Holmes
275,Section_1,David Holmes,"I didn’t see the list. I don’t know. There are other other people who have been in the mix for awhile on that set of issues, other people Secretary Perry has mentioned as being people to consult on reform.",33:36,Hill/Holmes
276,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Are they Americans?,33:52,Hill/Holmes
277,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,33:53,Hill/Holmes
278,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, do you also recall that Colonel Vindman spoke to Presidents Zelensky in that meeting?",33:55,Hill/Holmes
279,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,34:00,Hill/Holmes
280,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,What did he say to President Zelensky in terms of some of the issues that we’re addressing here in this investigation?,34:02,Hill/Holmes
281,Section_1,David Holmes,"Yes, sir. He was the last to speak. He made a general point about the importance of Ukraine, joint national security, and he said it’s very important that the Zelensky administration stay out of us domestic politics.",34:09,Hill/Holmes
282,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Was it your understanding that President Zelensky and the Ukrainians were already starting to feel some pressure to conduct these political investigations?,34:24,Hill/Holmes
283,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,34:32,Hill/Holmes
284,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Those were the ones related to Biden and Burisma and the 2016 election?,34:33,Hill/Holmes
285,Section_1,David Holmes,Correct.,34:38,Hill/Holmes
286,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, Dr. Hill, you also testified that around this same time in May, you learned that President Trump was receiving information from someone else at the National Security Council. Is that right?",34:39,Hill/Holmes
287,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"That’s not quite right. I was told in passing that someone else at the National Security Council, that president may want to speak to them because of some materials related to Ukraine.",34:50,Hill/Holmes
288,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Did that person indicate that the president thought that was the director of Ukraine?,35:06,Hill/Holmes
289,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"That was correct. It was a very brief conversation, just to be clear.",35:09,Hill/Holmes
290,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Who is the director of Ukraine?,35:12,Hill/Holmes
291,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"The director for Ukraine is Alex Vindman, Colonel Vindman.",35:13,Hill/Holmes
292,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Who did this individual in the Executive secretary’s office refer to?,35:20,Hill/Holmes
293,Section_1,Fiona Hill,The individual just said the name Kash.,35:25,Hill/Holmes
294,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Did you know who that was?,35:31,Hill/Holmes
295,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Initially, when I was thinking about it, I had to search my mind, and the only Kash that I knew at the National security council was Kash Patel.",35:31,Hill/Holmes
296,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Kasha Patel did not work on Ukraine matters that you oversaw, is that right?",35:36,Hill/Holmes
297,Section_1,Fiona Hill,Not that I oversaw. No.,35:40,Hill/Holmes
298,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,The indication is that Kash Patel had provided some information directly to the president without your knowledge?,35:43,Hill/Holmes
299,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That seemed to be the indication.,35:49,Hill/Holmes
300,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, I want to go back to the July 25th call right now where President Trump, in another excerpt, asked President Zelensky about his potential political opponent, Vice President Joe Biden. In this excerpt, the president said “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.”",35:52,Hill/Holmes
301,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, Dr. Hill, this was, of course, one of the allegations that Rudy Giuliani was pushing, is that right?",36:27,Hill/Holmes
302,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That’s correct.,36:34,Hill/Holmes
303,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Now confirmed in this July 25th call that the president was also interested in it?,36:34,Hill/Holmes
304,Section_1,Fiona Hill,Yes.,36:40,Hill/Holmes
305,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Ambassadors Volker and Sondland have tried to draw a distinction between their understanding of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens. But Dr. Hill, was it apparent to you that when President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, or anyone else was pushing for an investigation into Burisma that the reason why they wanted that investigation related to what President Trump said here, the Bidens.",36:41,Hill/Holmes
306,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"It was very apparent to me that that was what Rudy Giuliani intended. Yes. Intended to confer that Burisma was linked to the Bidens, and he said this publicly, repeatedly.",37:06,Hill/Holmes
307,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Mr. Holmes, you also understood that Burisma was code for Bidens?",37:15,Hill/Holmes
308,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,37:19,Hill/Holmes
309,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Do you think that anyone involved in Ukraine matters in the spring and the summer would understand that as well?,37:21,Hill/Holmes
310,Section_1,David Holmes,Yes.,37:25,Hill/Holmes
311,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Dr. Hill, are you aware of any evidence to support the allegations against Vice President Biden?",37:30,Hill/Holmes
312,Section_1,Fiona Hill,I am not. No.,37:35,Hill/Holmes
313,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"In fact, Mr. Holmes, the former Prosecutor General of Ukraine, who Vice President Biden encouraged to fire was actually corrupt, is that right?",37:38,Hill/Holmes
314,Section_1,David Holmes,Correct.,37:54,Hill/Holmes
315,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"And was not pursuing corruption investigations and prosecutions, right?",37:55,Hill/Holmes
316,Section_1,David Holmes,"My understanding is the prosecutor general at the time, Shokin, was not at that time pursuing investigations of Burisma or the Bidens.",38:01,Hill/Holmes
317,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"In fact, removing that corrupt prosecutor general was part of the United States anti-corruption policy. Isn’t that correct?",38:11,Hill/Holmes
318,Section_1,David Holmes,"That’s correct, and not just us, but all of our allies and other institutions that were involved in Ukraine at the time.",38:20,Hill/Holmes
319,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Mm-hmm (affirmative).,38:24,Hill/Holmes
320,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, Dr. Hill, you indicated earlier that you had understood that a White House meeting was conditioned on the pursuit by Ukraine of these investigations, and I want to focus on the July 10th meeting in the White House where that came to light. You indicated that, in your testimony, that there was a large meeting that Ambassador Bolton ran where Ambassadors Sondland, Volcker and Secretary Perry also attended. Is that right?",38:26,Hill/Holmes
321,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That’s correct. Yes.,38:54,Hill/Holmes
322,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Why were they included in that meeting with two Ukrainian officials about national security matters?,38:55,Hill/Holmes
323,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Well, the initial intent had not been to include them. We’d anticipated that the two Ukrainian officials would have a number of meetings, as is usually the procedure, and that there would be meetings at the State Department, potentially also at the Energy Department. Then there was a request to have Ambassadors Sondland and Volker included, coming directly from their offices. As a result of that, clearly given the important role that Secretary Perry was playing in the energy sector reform in Ukraine and the fact that he’d also been in the delegation to the presidential inauguration in Ukraine, we decided that it would be better than to include all three of them.",39:03,Hill/Holmes
324,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, toward the end of this meeting, the Ukrainians raised their ongoing desire for an Oval Office meeting. Is that right?",39:43,Hill/Holmes
325,Section_1,Fiona Hill,That’s correct.,39:51,Hill/Holmes
326,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,What happened after they did that?,39:52,Hill/Holmes
327,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Well, I listen very carefully to Ambassador Sondland’s testimony yesterday, so I want to actually point out something where I think it’s easy to explain why he had a different interpretation of how this came into being.",39:55,Hill/Holmes
328,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"The meeting had initially been scheduled for about 45-minutes to an hour, and it was definitely in the wrap-up phase of the meeting when this occurred. We’d gone through a series of discussions, Alexander Daniluk, who is at this point the designated National Security Advisor of Ukraine, really wanted to get into the weeds of how he might reform a national security council. He talked to me about this prior to the meeting. He was hoping and had had this opportunity with the National Security Advisor of the United States to get his firsthand opinions and thoughts on what might happen.",40:08,Hill/Holmes
329,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"We’d also wanted to go through a discussion about how important it was for Ukraine to get its energy sector reform underway, and clearly Secretary Perry had some talking points to this. This is an issue that Ambassador Bolton was also interested in.",40:45,Hill/Holmes
330,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"And then we knew that the Ukrainians would have on their agenda, inevitably, the question about a meeting. As we get through the main discussion, we are going into that wrap-up phase. The Ukrainians, Mr. Daniluk, starts to ask about a White House meeting and Ambassador Bolton was trying to parry this back. Although he’s the National Security Advisor, he’s not in charge of scheduling the meeting. We have input recommending the meetings, and this goes through a whole process. It’s not Ambassador Bolton’s role to start pulling out the schedule and start saying, ” Right, well, we’re going to look and see if this Tuesday in this month is going to work with this.” He does not as a matter of course like to discuss the details of these meetings, he likes to leave them to the appropriate staff for this. So this was already going to be an uncomfortable issue.",40:58,Hill/Holmes
331,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"As Ambassador Bolton was trying to move that part of the discussion away, I think he was going to try to deflect it onto another wrap-up topic, Ambassador Sondland leaned in basically to say, “Well, we have an agreement that there will be a meeting if specific investigations are put underway.” That’s when I saw Ambassador Bolton stiffen. I was sitting behind him in the chair, and I saw him sit back slightly like this. He’d been more moving forward, like I am, to the table. For me, that was an unmistakable body language, and it caught my attention. Then he looked up to the clock and at his watch, or towards his wrist in any case … Again, I was sitting behind him … and basically said, “Well, it’s been really great to see you. I’m afraid I’ve got another meeting.”",41:45,Hill/Holmes
332,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Did Ambassador Sondland say who his agreement on this White House meeting was with?,42:34,Hill/Holmes
333,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"In that particular juncture, I don’t believe so. It was later, which I’m sure you’ll want to talk about, that he did say more specifically.",42:39,Hill/Holmes
334,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,What did he say later?,42:46,Hill/Holmes
335,Section_1,Fiona Hill,Later he said that he had an agreement with Chief of Staff Mulvaney that in return for investigations this meeting would get scheduled.,42:48,Hill/Holmes
336,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Was he specific at that point, later about the investigations that he was referring to?",42:57,Hill/Holmes
337,Section_1,Fiona Hill,He said the investigations in Burisma.,43:03,Hill/Holmes
338,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Now, did you have a conversation with Ambassador Bolton after this subsequent meeting with Ambassador Sondland?",43:04,Hill/Holmes
339,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"I had a discussion with Ambassador Bolton both after the meeting in his office, a very brief one, and then one immediately afterwards, the subsequent meeting.",43:09,Hill/Holmes
340,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"The subsequent meeting, or after both meetings when you spoke to him and relayed to him what Ambassador Sondland said, what did Ambassador Bolton say to you?",43:18,Hill/Holmes
341,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Well, I just want to highlight first of all that Ambassador Bolton wanted me to hold back in the room immediately after the meeting. Again, I was sitting on the sofa with colleague and everybody else was at the table.",43:28,Hill/Holmes
342,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,"Right. But just in that second meeting, what did he say?",43:41,Hill/Holmes
343,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"Yes, but he was making a very strong point that he wanted to know exactly what was being said. When I came back and relayed to it to him, he had some very specific instruction for me. I’m presuming that that’s the question that you’re asking.",43:41,Hill/Holmes
344,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,What was that specific instruction?,43:53,Hill/Holmes
345,Section_1,Fiona Hill,"The specific instruction was that I had to go to the lawyers, to John Eisenberg, our senior counsel for the National Security Council, to basically say, “You tell Eisenberg Ambassador Bolton told me that I am not part of this, whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up.”",43:54,Hill/Holmes
346,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,What did you understand him to mean by the “drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland were cooking up?”,44:12,Hill/Holmes
347,Section_1,Fiona Hill,I took it to mean investigations for a meeting.,44:17,Hill/Holmes
348,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,Did you go speak to the lawyers?,44:22,Hill/Holmes
349,Section_1,Fiona Hill,I certainly did.,44:24,Hill/Holmes
350,Section_1,Daniel Goldman,You relayed everything that you just told us and more?,44:27,Hill/Holmes

363,Section_1,Adam Schiff,"That concludes the majority questioning. We are expected to have votes, I think fairly soon. This would be a appropriate time to break and we’ll resume with the minority 45-minutes. If people before they leave could allow the witnesses to leave first, and if committee members could come back promptly after votes.",45:58,Hill/Holmes
